## ⛔ DO NOT UPDATE THESE FILES

All new work items, status updates, and tracking must go through the Product Backlog.

If you need to reference historical information from these files, that's fine, but:
- **DO NOT** add new items here
- **DO NOT** update statuses here
- **DO NOT** use these for planning

## 📝 Migration Notes

The migration to Product Backlog was completed to:
1. Establish a single source of truth for all work
2. Follow proper Agile/Scrum practices
3. Simplify work tracking and prioritization
4. Reduce confusion about where to track items

All critical issues, features, and tech debt are now properly categorized and prioritized in the Product Backlog using the standard work item types:
- **VS** (Vertical Slice) - Features
- **HF** (Hotfix) - Critical issues
- **TD** (Tech Debt) - Improvements
- **BF** (Bug Fix) - Defects
