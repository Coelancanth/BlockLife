## 📊 Implementation Success Patterns

### What Makes a Successful Implementation
Based on F1 Block Placement success:

1. **Architecture First** - Start with fitness tests to define constraints
2. **TDD Discipline** - Red-Green-Refactor cycle religiously followed  
3. **Vertical Slices** - Complete feature slices, not horizontal layers
4. **Documentation Driven** - Clear implementation plan before coding
5. **Reference Following** - Use established patterns consistently
6. **Quality Gates** - No compromise on test coverage and architecture

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid
Lessons from project post-mortems:

1. **Big Bang Implementation** - Implement in small, testable increments
2. **Architecture Violations** - Never compromise on Clean Architecture boundaries
3. **Notification Pipeline Shortcuts** - Always follow complete MediatR → Static Bridge → Presenter pattern
4. **Test-After Development** - Tests must drive implementation, not follow it
5. **Documentation Debt** - Update docs with implementation, not after

## 🎯 Next Quarter Roadmap

### Q1 2025 Focus
1. **Complete Move Block Feature** (highest priority)
   - Finish Godot integration
   - Establish as second reference implementation
   
2. **Animation System Foundation** 
   - Start implementation after Move Block completion
   - Focus on core animation queuing and state management

3. **Developer Experience Improvements**
   - Advanced Logger implementation
   - Better debugging and development tools

### Success Criteria
- 2 complete reference implementations (F1 + Move Block)
- Animation system foundation ready
- Enhanced developer tooling operational
- Maintained 0 architecture violations
- >90% test coverage for all core logic
