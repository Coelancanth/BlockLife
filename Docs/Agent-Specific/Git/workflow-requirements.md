## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Git Workflow Requirements

**üö´ NEVER WORK DIRECTLY ON MAIN BRANCH - NO EXCEPTIONS**

**MANDATORY Git Workflow for ALL Changes:**
1. **Create feature branch FIRST**: `git checkout -b <type>/<description>`
2. **Make changes on branch**: Never on main
3. **Create Pull Request**: Always for review
4. **Wait for approval**: Before merging
5. **Follow guide**: [Git_Workflow_Guide.md](../../Shared/Guides/Git_Workflow_Guide.md)

**Branch Types**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`, `test/`, `chore/`, `hotfix/`

## Pull Request Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Always use the repository's PR template located at `.github/pull_request_template.md`

**Required Sections (will fail CI if missing):**
- ‚úÖ **## Changes** - Features Added, Bugs Fixed, Refactoring
- ‚úÖ **## Testing** - TDD workflow, test coverage, testing instructions  
- ‚úÖ **## Checklist** - Documentation, Architecture, Code Quality, Final Checks

**Example gh pr create command:**
```bash
gh pr create --title "feat: descriptive feature title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
