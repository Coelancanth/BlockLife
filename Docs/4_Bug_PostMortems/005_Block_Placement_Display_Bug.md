# Bug Post-Mortem: Block Placement Display Bug

## Executive Summary

**Date**: August 2025  
**Severity**: High - Core feature non-functional  
**Status**: Resolved  
**Duration**: [Duration of investigation and fix]

## Problem Description

### Issue
Block placement commands were being processed successfully by the business logic (confirmed via logging), but the UI was not updating to show the newly placed blocks. The grid display remained unchanged despite successful command execution and state updates.

### Symptoms
- PlaceBlockCommand handlers executed successfully
- GridStateService showed correct state updates
- No error messages or exceptions
- UI grid remained unchanged after block placement
- Manual grid refresh (if available) would show correctly placed blocks

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Notification Pipeline Break

The issue was identified as a **broken notification pipeline** between command handlers and UI presenters. Specifically:

1. **Inconsistent Handler Patterns**: The `PlaceBlockCommandHandler` used the `SimulationManager` effect queue pattern, while `MoveBlockCommandHandler` used direct MediatR notification publishing.

2. **Empty Handler Anti-Pattern**: `EmptyBlockPlacementHandlers` were created to satisfy MediatR interface requirements but provided no actual functionality to bridge notifications to presenters.

3. **Unprocessed Effect Queue**: Effects were being queued via `SimulationManager.QueueEffect()` but `ProcessQueuedEffectsAsync()` was never called in the application lifecycle.

4. **Missing Presenter Bridge**: Presenters couldn't implement `INotificationHandler<T>` directly due to DI container constraints, but no alternative bridging mechanism was established.

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Broken Flow
```
PlaceBlockCommand → PlaceBlockCommandHandler → SimulationManager.QueueEffect() 
                                             → [EFFECTS NEVER PROCESSED]
                                             → [NO NOTIFICATIONS PUBLISHED]
                                             → [PRESENTERS NEVER NOTIFIED]
                                             → [UI NEVER UPDATED]
```

### The Working Flow (Move Block)
```
MoveBlockCommand → MoveBlockCommandHandler → await _mediator.Publish(notification)
                                          → MediatR notification system
                                          → Static event bridges
                                          → Presenters notified
                                          → UI updated
```

### Key Architectural Issues Discovered

#### 1. Feature Implementation Inconsistency
Different features were using completely different notification patterns:
- **Move Block**: Direct MediatR publishing with static event bridges
- **Block Placement**: Effect queuing with no processing mechanism

#### 2. Effect Queue Promises Not Kept
The `SimulationManager` provided an effect queuing mechanism but:
- No documentation on when/how effects are processed
- No lifecycle hook to call `ProcessQueuedEffectsAsync()`
- Created a false impression that effects would be automatically processed

#### 3. Empty Handler Anti-Pattern
Creating "empty" handlers that satisfy interface requirements but provide no functionality indicates missing architectural pieces:
```csharp
// Anti-pattern: Handlers that do nothing
public class EmptyBlockPlacementHandler : INotificationHandler<BlockPlacedNotification>
{
    public Task Handle(BlockPlacedNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        // Empty - no actual handling
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

#### 4. Presenter-MediatR Bridge Gap
Architecture constraints prevented direct presenter registration as notification handlers, but no documented pattern existed for bridging this gap.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Standardized Notification Pattern
All command handlers now use the same pattern:
```csharp
public async Task<Fin<Unit>> Handle(PlaceBlockCommand command, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
    // ... validation and business logic ...
    
    // CONSISTENT PATTERN: Direct MediatR publishing
    await _mediator.Publish(new BlockPlacedNotification(command.Position, command.BlockType), cancellationToken);
    
    return Unit.Default;
}
```

### 2. Static Event Bridge Pattern
Established the standard pattern for bridging MediatR notifications to presenters:
```csharp
// In Core project - static event bridge
public class BlockPlacementNotificationHandler : INotificationHandler<BlockPlacedNotification>
{
    public static event Action<BlockPlacedNotification>? BlockPlaced;
    
    public Task Handle(BlockPlacedNotification notification, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        BlockPlaced?.Invoke(notification);
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

// In Presenter
public void Initialize()
{
    BlockPlacementNotificationHandler.BlockPlaced += OnBlockPlaced;
}
```

### 3. Pipeline Tracing
Added logging at key decision points to make notification flow visible:
```csharp
_logger.LogInformation("Publishing BlockPlacedNotification for position {Position}", command.Position);
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Feature Implementation Consistency
**Problem**: Different features implemented notification patterns differently.
**Solution**: Establish and enforce consistent patterns across all features.
**Action**: Document the standard notification pattern and enforce through architecture tests.

### 2. Empty Handler Anti-Pattern Recognition
**Problem**: Empty handlers indicate missing architectural pieces.
**Solution**: When creating empty handlers, investigate why they're needed and implement proper bridging.
**Action**: Add architecture test to detect and flag empty handlers.

### 3. Effect Queue vs Direct Publishing
**Problem**: Effect queuing without processing is a broken promise pattern.
**Solution**: Either process effects immediately or use direct notification publishing.
**Action**: Document when to use each pattern and ensure processing lifecycle is clear.

### 4. Presenter-MediatR Bridge Standardization
**Problem**: No clear pattern for connecting MediatR notifications to presenters.
**Solution**: Static event bridges as the standard pattern.
**Action**: Document and template this pattern for all notification types.

### 5. Pipeline Visibility Requirements
**Problem**: Complex notification pipelines need diagnostic capabilities.
**Solution**: Built-in logging at key pipeline decision points.
**Action**: Ensure all handlers log notification publishing and processing.

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Architecture Test Additions
```csharp
[Fact]
public void CommandHandlers_ShouldUseConsistentNotificationPattern()
{
    // Test that all command handlers follow the same notification pattern
}

[Fact]
public void NotificationHandlers_ShouldNotBeEmpty()
{
    // Test that no notification handlers are empty/no-op
}
```

### 2. Workflow Documentation Updates
- Add consistency checks to TDD workflow
- Require notification pattern validation in code reviews
- Include notification pipeline testing in integration tests

### 3. Template Standardization
Create standard templates for:
- Command handlers with notification publishing
- Static event bridge handlers
- Presenter initialization with event subscription

### 4. Pipeline Debugging Guide
Document standard debugging approach for notification pipeline issues:
1. Check command handler logging
2. Verify notification publishing
3. Confirm bridge handler registration
4. Validate presenter event subscription
5. Test with manual notification triggering
