# Block Placement Implementation Plan ‚úÖ COMPLETED
*Created by Tech Lead - Reference Implementation*

**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & PRODUCTION-READY** - Serves as reference pattern for future features  
**Location**: `src/Features/Block/Placement/`  
**Tests**: 71 passing tests including 16 architecture tests  

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Plan

### Technical Approach
- **Pattern**: Command/Handler with CQRS (foundational pattern)
- **State**: GridStateService for block persistence  
- **UI**: MVP with GridPresenter managing view updates
- **Error Handling**: Fin<T> monads for functional error handling
- **Testing**: TDD with 4-pillar architecture (Unit/Integration/Architecture/Performance)

### Phase 1: Domain Logic ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Est: 6-8 hours)
- [x] Write failing test for PlaceBlockCommand
- [x] Create PlaceBlockCommand record with required properties
- [x] Write failing test for PlaceBlockCommandHandler  
- [x] Implement handler with grid state validation
- [x] Add Fin<Unit> error handling with functional composition
- [x] Create RemoveBlockCommand/Handler variants
- [x] Register commands in DI container

### Phase 2: Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Est: 4-6 hours)
- [x] Implement GridStateService as single source of truth
- [x] Create IGridStateService interface with async operations
- [x] Add block validation rules (PositionIsValid, PositionIsEmpty, BlockExists)
- [x] Implement notification publishing via MediatR
- [x] Test state persistence and retrieval

### Phase 3: Presentation ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Est: 8-10 hours)
- [x] Define IBlockManagementView and IGridView interfaces
- [x] Create GridPresenter with MVP pattern
- [x] Implement notification subscription bridge
- [x] Build basic Godot scenes for visualization
- [x] Wire up command dispatch from UI events

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish ‚úÖ COMPLETED (Est: 2-4 hours)
- [x] End-to-end integration tests with GdUnit4
- [x] Edge case validation (boundary conditions, invalid positions)
- [x] Performance optimization (N+1 query fixes, grid size limits)
- [x] Architecture fitness tests for pattern compliance

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Async Operations**: All state changes use async/await for consistency
- **Single State Source**: GridStateService handles both IGridStateService and IBlockRepository
- **Notification Pattern**: MediatR for domain events, static event bridge for presentation
- **Error Handling**: Fin<T> monads throughout command pipeline
- **Testing Strategy**: TDD with FluentAssertions and architecture compliance tests

### Key Architecture Patterns Established
```csharp
// Command Pattern
public sealed record PlaceBlockCommand : ICommand
{
    public required Vector2Int Position { get; init; }
    public required BlockType BlockType { get; init; }
}

// Handler Pattern with Functional Error Handling
public class PlaceBlockCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<PlaceBlockCommand, Fin<Unit>>
{
    public async Task<Fin<Unit>> Handle(PlaceBlockCommand request, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        return await ValidatePosition(request.Position)
            .BindAsync(_ => PlaceBlockInGrid(request))
            .BindAsync(_ => PublishNotification(request));
    }
}

// MVP Presenter Pattern
public class GridPresenter : PresenterBase<IGridView>
{
    public override void Initialize()
    {
        BlockPlacementNotificationBridge.BlockPlaced += OnBlockPlaced;
    }
}
```

### Folder Structure Created
```
src/Features/Block/Placement/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlaceBlockCommand.cs              # CQRS Command
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlaceBlockCommandHandler.cs       # Business logic implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RemoveBlockCommand.cs             # Removal variant
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RemoveBlockCommandHandler.cs      # Removal logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rules/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IPositionIsValidRule.cs        # Validation contract
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PositionIsValidRule.cs         # Grid boundary validation

tests/BlockLife.Core.Tests/Features/Block/Placement/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PlaceBlockCommandHandlerTests.cs  # Unit tests (TDD)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ RemoveBlockCommandHandlerTests.cs # Removal tests  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Rules/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ PositionIsValidRuleTests.cs    # Validation tests
```

### Performance Characteristics
- **Grid Operations**: O(1) for position-based lookups
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient block storage with minimal allocations
- **Concurrency**: Thread-safe operations via GridStateService
- **Scalability**: Tested up to 1000x1000 grid size

### Risks Identified & Mitigated
- ‚úÖ **State Consistency**: Single GridStateService prevents dual-state issues
- ‚úÖ **Memory Leaks**: Proper event subscription/unsubscription in presenters
- ‚úÖ **Performance**: Grid size limits and optimized adjacency queries
- ‚úÖ **Integration**: Comprehensive test coverage prevents regressions

## Reference Implementation Usage

**For new features, copy this pattern:**
1. **Copy folder structure** ‚Üí rename to your feature domain
2. **Replace "PlaceBlock"** with your action name  
3. **Update command properties** for your specific use case
4. **Implement your business rules** in Rules/ folder
5. **Follow same testing patterns** with TDD approach
6. **Use GridStateService** for any grid-related state operations

**Key files to reference:**
- `PlaceBlockCommandHandler.cs` - Shows functional error handling pattern
- `GridPresenter.cs` - Shows MVP presenter implementation  
- `PlaceBlockCommandHandlerTests.cs` - Shows TDD test structure
- `PositionIsValidRule.cs` - Shows validation rule pattern

**Total Implementation Time**: 20-28 hours (completed 2025-08-13)
