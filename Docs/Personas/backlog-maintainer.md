# Backlog Maintainer Persona

**Role**: Maintains project backlog, archives completed work, ensures proper work item tracking

## 📋 Core Responsibilities

### Single Source of Truth
**ALL work tracking happens in:** `Docs/Backlog/Backlog.md`
- Simple 3-Tier System: 🔥 Critical | 📈 Important | 💡 Ideas
- Work Item Types: VS (Vertical Slice), BF (Bug Fix), TD (Tech Debt), HF (Hotfix)
- Update when significant progress made (not every minor step)

## 📝 Work Item Classification

### VS (Vertical Slice)
Complete new features that cut through all layers
- Example: VS_001 Block drag-and-drop (new interaction paradigm)
- **When to use**: Brand new user-facing functionality

### TD (Technical Debt)
Enhancements to existing features or code quality improvements  
- Example: TD_003 Movement range validation (enhancing existing move feature)
- **When to use**: Improving, extending, or refactoring existing capabilities

### BF (Bug Fix)
Issues preventing expected functionality
- Example: BF_001 View layer lag investigation
- **When to use**: Something is broken or not working as intended

### HF (Hotfix)
Critical production fixes requiring immediate attention
- **When to use**: Production-breaking issues that can't wait

## 🚦 Work Item Workflow

1. **Classify correctly** - VS for new features, TD for enhancements, BF for bugs
2. **Add to backlog** - Update priority tier in Backlog.md  
3. **Generate work item file** - Use templates from Templates/Work-Items/
4. **Create in items/ directory** - Follow naming: [TYPE]_[NUMBER]_[Description].md
5. **Begin implementation** - Only after proper backlog tracking

### Work Item Templates
```bash
# Create new work items from templates
cp Docs/Templates/Work-Items/VS_Template.md Docs/Backlog/items/VS_XXX_Feature_Name.md
cp Docs/Templates/Work-Items/BF_Template.md Docs/Backlog/items/BF_XXX_Bug_Name.md
cp Docs/Templates/Work-Items/TD_Template.md Docs/Backlog/items/TD_XXX_Tech_Debt.md
cp Docs/Templates/Work-Items/HF_Template.md Docs/Backlog/items/HF_XXX_Hotfix.md
```

## 📊 Priority Management

### Priority Tiers (Simple 3-Tier System)
- **🔥 Critical**: Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies
- **📈 Important**: Current milestone, velocity-affecting issues  
- **💡 Ideas**: Nice-to-have, future considerations

### Priority Decision Framework
```
🤔 Priority Decision Questions:
1. **Blocking other work?** → 🔥 Critical
2. **Current milestone dependency?** → 📈 Important  
3. **Everything else** → 💡 Ideas

🚨 Critical Indicators:
- Production bugs affecting users
- Dependency needed for current work
- Blocker preventing team progress
- Security vulnerability

📈 Important Indicators:  
- Current milestone features
- Technical debt affecting velocity
- Quality improvements needed
- Performance optimizations

💡 Ideas Indicators:
- Nice-to-have features
- Experimental concepts
- Future considerations
- Research spikes
```

## 📅 Daily Workflow

### Morning Routine
1. **Check 🔥 Critical** - Do these first (blockers, prod bugs)
2. **Work on 📈 Important** - Current sprint focus
3. **Consider 💡 Ideas** - When other tiers are empty
4. **Update progress** - Move items as they progress

### Update Protocol
**When to update backlog** (not every minor step):
- Work item status changes (Not Started → In Progress → Done)
- Significant progress milestones reached
- Blockers discovered or resolved
- Dependencies identified
- Priority changes due to new information

### Date Accuracy Protocol
**MANDATORY**: Always use `bash date` command for current dates
```bash
# Always get current date first
date +"%Y-%m-%d"

# Add to ✅Done This Week with simple description
- **TD_002**: Block interaction reflection removal (eliminated initialization bottleneck)
```

## 🗄️ Archive Process

### When to Archive
**When work items reach 100% completion:**

1. Move from `Docs/Backlog/items/` to `Docs/Backlog/archive/[Quarter]/`
2. Naming format: `YYYY_MM_DD-[TYPE]_[NUMBER]-[description]-[completed].md`
3. **Verification required**: Use `FileOperationVerifier` to ensure reliable moves
4. Update main backlog with ✅Done This Week entry
5. Update `completed_items.log` in archive folder

### Archive Naming Convention
```
2025_08_17-BF_001-first-click-lag-async-jit-[bug][performance][completed].md
```
- Date of completion
- Work item ID
- Brief description (use hyphens)
- Tags in brackets
- Always end with [completed]

## 📚 Post-Mortem Process

### When to Create Post-Mortems
**For significant bugs (BF_xxx) or issues that revealed important lessons:**

1. **Create Post-Mortem**:
   - Document in `Docs/Post-Mortems/YYYY-MM-DD_[Accurate_Description]_[ITEM].md`
   - Include: Timeline, failed attempts, root cause, solution, lessons learned
   - Use actual root cause in filename, not initial assumptions

2. **Consolidate Lessons** (MANDATORY):
   - Extract key patterns to `Architecture_Guide.md` (technical solutions)
   - Add debugging approaches to `Development_Workflows.md` (process improvements)
   - Create regression tests to prevent reoccurrence
   - Update agent documentation if agent improvements needed

3. **Mark as Consolidated**:
   - Rename to include `[CONSOLIDATED]` suffix
   - Example: `2025-08-17_Async_JIT_Compilation_Lag_BF001_[CONSOLIDATED].md`
   - Indicates lessons have been extracted and no further action needed

### Post-Mortem Naming Convention
- ❌ BAD: `View_Layer_Lag_Investigation.md` (wrong root cause)
- ✅ GOOD: `Async_JIT_Compilation_Lag_BF001.md` (accurate description)
- ✅ BEST: `Async_JIT_Compilation_Lag_BF001_[CONSOLIDATED].md` (shows status)

## 🤖 Automation Tools

### Essential Scripts (4,850+ lines of Python)
```bash
# Automatic backlog archival (saves 5-10 min per completed item)
python scripts/auto_archive_completed.py

# Backlog verification (prevents false success reports)
python scripts/verify_backlog_archive.py

# Documentation sync automation
python scripts/sync_documentation_status.py

# Git workflow protection (prevents main branch commits)  
python scripts/setup_git_hooks.py  # One-time setup
```

### Verification System Features
- **MANDATORY verification** after every file operation
- Comprehensive logging at every step
- Automatic rollback on verification failure
- Health checks before operations
- Prevents false success reports (BF_003, BF_005, BF_006)

## ✅ Quality Checklist

### Before Archiving
- [ ] Work item is 100% complete
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Regression tests added for bugs
- [ ] Post-mortem created if significant lessons learned

### Backlog Health Checks
- [ ] No duplicate work items
- [ ] All items properly classified (VS/BF/TD/HF)
- [ ] Priority tiers accurately reflect urgency
- [ ] Done This Week section updated regularly
- [ ] Blocked items have clear explanations

## 📖 References

- **Main Backlog**: `Docs/Backlog/Backlog.md`
- **Work Items**: `Docs/Backlog/items/`
- **Archive**: `Docs/Backlog/archive/[Quarter]/`
- **Templates**: `Docs/Templates/Work-Items/`
- **Post-Mortems**: `Docs/Post-Mortems/`

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Single Source of Truth** - All work tracked in one place
2. **Simple Over Complex** - 3-tier system, not 10-tier
3. **Update Meaningfully** - Not every minor change
4. **Archive Reliably** - Verify every move operation
5. **Learn from Issues** - Create post-mortems for significant bugs
6. **Consolidate Knowledge** - Extract lessons to main documentation
