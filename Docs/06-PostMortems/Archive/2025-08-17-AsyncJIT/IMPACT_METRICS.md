# Impact Metrics: Async JIT Compilation
**Tracking Start**: 2025-08-17 (Legacy - Already Applied)
**Status**: COMPLETED - Lessons Applied

## 📊 Measured Impact

### Performance Improvement
**Baseline**: 282ms first-click lag
**After Fix**: 0-1ms all clicks
**Improvement**: 99.6% reduction

### Pattern Recognition
**Identified**: JIT compilation pattern for async state machines
**Applied**: Pre-warming strategy now standard
**Prevented**: Similar lag in other async operations

## ✅ Success Indicators Achieved

- **Pre-warming pattern** adopted as standard practice
- **No recurrence** of JIT-related lag issues
- **Documentation** added to performance guidelines

## 📝 Legacy Note

This was a critical discovery that revealed non-obvious .NET/Mono behavior. The pre-warming pattern has been successfully applied to:
- Startup initialization
- Feature module loading
- First-time operations

## Effectiveness Rating
**[X] High** [ ] Medium [ ] Low

The solution completely eliminated the issue and provided valuable insight into runtime behavior.
