# Extracted Lessons: BlockInputManager Refactoring
**Migration Date**: 2025-08-18 (from legacy archive)
**Original Date**: 2025-08-17
**Issue**: 700+ line monolithic input manager

## ðŸ“š Lessons Already Consolidated

### Key Achievement
Successfully refactored monolithic 700+ line `BlockInputManager` into focused, testable components following Clean Architecture.

### Refactoring Applied
1. **Separated Concerns**
   - Input routing (BlockInputManager)
   - Movement logic (BlockMovementHandler)
   - Placement logic (BlockPlacementHandler)
   - Selection logic (BlockSelectionHandler)

2. **Dependency Injection**
   - All handlers injected via DI
   - Clear dependencies
   - Testable in isolation

3. **Single Responsibility**
   - Each handler has one clear purpose
   - Easy to understand and modify
   - Reduced cognitive load

## ðŸŽ¯ Patterns Established

### Modularization Pattern
```
Monolithic Class
    â†“
Identify Responsibilities
    â†“
Extract to Handlers
    â†“
Wire via DI
```

### Benefits Realized
- **Maintainability**: 700 lines â†’ ~200 lines per component
- **Testability**: Each handler testable in isolation
- **Clarity**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new input handlers

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons for Future

1. **Don't fear the refactor** - Large classes can be systematically decomposed
2. **Use DI as guide** - If it's hard to inject, it's doing too much
3. **Test as you extract** - Ensure behavior preserved
4. **Document the why** - Future devs need context

## Status
**LEGACY MIGRATION** - Already consolidated, moved to new archive structure for consistency.
