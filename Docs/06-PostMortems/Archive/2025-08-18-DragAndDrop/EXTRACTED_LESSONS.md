# Extracted Lessons: Drag-and-Drop Implementation
**Consolidation Date**: 2025-08-18  
**Consolidated By**: Debugger Expert  
**Original Post-Mortems**: 2 files

## ðŸ“š Lessons Extracted and Applied

### To QuickReference.md
âœ… **Added "Critical Lessons Learned" section**:
- LanguageExt Error.Message behavior
- MediatR auto-discovery pitfalls
- PresenterBase method names
- Test utility patterns (BlockBuilder vs BlockFactory)

### To Workflow.md  
âœ… **Enhanced Pre-Implementation Checklist**:
- Verify base methods exist before overriding
- Check framework documentation with Context7
- Map ALL integration points when replacing features

### To Context7Examples.md
âœ… **Created comprehensive examples**:
- LanguageExt Error handling queries
- MediatR registration pattern queries
- Godot lifecycle method queries
- Test utility documentation queries

### To PostMortem_Template.md
âœ… **Added process causes**:
- "Didn't query Context7 for API documentation"
- "Assumed method/behavior without verification"

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Patterns Identified

### Pattern 1: Framework Misunderstandings (60% of bugs)
**Root Cause**: Coding based on assumptions rather than documentation
**Solution Applied**: Context7 integration for instant API verification

### Pattern 2: Addition Bias
**Root Cause**: Easier to add new code than modify existing
**Solution Applied**: Explicit "Replace Protocol" in workflow

### Pattern 3: Positive-Only Testing
**Root Cause**: Not testing what shouldn't happen
**Solution Applied**: Negative testing mandate in workflow

## ðŸ’¡ Impact Metrics (To Track)

Track these over next sprint:
- [ ] Reduction in "method doesn't exist" errors
- [ ] Reduction in framework confusion bugs
- [ ] Increase in Context7 queries before coding
- [ ] Decrease in assumption-based bugs

## ðŸ“Š Summary

**2 post-mortems â†’ 4 document updates â†’ 3 systemic improvements**

The drag-and-drop implementation revealed that most bugs aren't from complex logic but from simple oversights. Context7 integration directly addresses this root cause.
