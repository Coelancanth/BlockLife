# Impact Metrics: CI Timing Test Fix
**Tracking Start**: 2025-08-18  
**Next Review**: 2025-09-01

## 📊 Metrics to Track

### False CI Failures
**Baseline**: ~50% failure rate on main branch merges
- [ ] Week 1: ___ false failures
- [ ] Week 2: ___ false failures  
- [ ] Total Prevented: ___

**Target**: 0% false timing failures

### Developer Time Saved
**Baseline**: 2-4 hours per false failure
- [ ] Week 1: ___ hours saved
- [ ] Week 2: ___ hours saved
- [ ] Total Time Saved: ___

**Target**: Zero time lost to timing issues

### Test Categorization Adoption
**Baseline**: 0 tests categorized
- [ ] Performance tests identified: ___
- [ ] Tests properly categorized: ___
- [ ] CI pipeline updated: Yes/No

**Target**: 100% of timing tests categorized

### Environment Detection Usage
**Baseline**: No environment detection
- [ ] TestEnvironment helper created: Yes/No
- [ ] Tests using Skip.If pattern: ___
- [ ] Environment-aware tests: ___

**Target**: All timing tests environment-aware

## 🎯 Success Indicators

✅ **Working** if:
- No more timing-related CI failures
- TD_006 implementation progressing
- Team adopting test categorization

⚠️ **Needs Adjustment** if:
- Still seeing occasional timing failures
- Performance tests not being run anywhere
- Resistance to categorization

❌ **Failed** if:
- Timing failures continue
- Solution not scalable
- Team reverting to old patterns

## 📝 Implementation Notes

**Immediate Fix Applied**: Tests skipped with `[Theory(Skip = "...")]`
**Long-term Solution**: TD_006 for proper test separation
