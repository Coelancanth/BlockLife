### TD_048: Migrate FsCheck Property-Based Tests to 3.x API [Score: 30/100]
**Status**: Done ✅
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: M (4-8h actual: 2h)
**Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [TESTING] [MIGRATION] [FSCHECK] [PROPERTY-BASED]
**Created**: 2025-08-22
**Completed**: 2025-08-22

**What**: Update FsCheck property-based tests from 2.16.6 to 3.3.0 API
**Why**: FsCheck 3.x has breaking API changes; tests currently disabled and moved to `FsCheck_Migration_TD047/`

**How**:
- ✅ Research FsCheck 3.x API changes (use Context7 if available)
- ✅ Update `Prop.ForAll` usage to new API patterns
- ✅ Fix `Gen<T>`, `Arb`, and `Arbitrary<T>` usage
- ✅ Resolve Property attribute conflicts with xUnit
- ✅ Update custom generators in `BlockLifeGenerators.cs`
- ✅ Update property tests in `SimplePropertyTests.cs`
- ✅ Re-enable FsCheck.Xunit package reference
- ✅ Move tests back from `FsCheck_Migration_TD047/` to proper location
- ✅ Ensure all 9 property-based tests pass (found 2 additional tests)

**Done When**:
- ✅ All FsCheck tests compile with 3.x API
- ✅ All property-based tests passing (9 tests total)
- ✅ FsCheck.Xunit package re-enabled in project
- ✅ No references to old 2.x API patterns
- ✅ Property tests moved back to proper test directory

**Depends On**: None

**Problem Context**: Package updates completed but FsCheck 3.x has extensive breaking changes requiring dedicated migration effort. Tests temporarily disabled to unblock other infrastructure updates.

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-21):
- Actual Complexity: 35/100 (slightly underestimated due to API redesign)
- Decision: APPROVED - Legitimate technical debt from package updates
- FsCheck 3.x is fundamental API redesign, not just version bump
- Property testing provides valuable edge case coverage for game logic
- Migration necessary to re-enable 7 disabled tests

**Test Specialist Completion** (2025-08-22):
- **Migration completed successfully** in 2 hours
- **Key API changes applied**:
  - Custom generators now return `Gen<T>` instead of `Arbitrary<T>`
  - Added `using FsCheck.Fluent;` for C# extension methods
  - Use `.ToArbitrary()` to convert generators for `Prop.ForAll`
  - Removed `Arb.From()` wrapper, return generators directly
- **Results**: All 9 property-based tests passing (found 2 additional non-property tests)
- **Full test suite**: 106 tests passing with no regressions
- **Cleanup**: Removed temporary `FsCheck_Migration_TD047/` folder
- **Impact**: Property-based testing infrastructure fully restored for edge case coverage
- **Documentation**: Created FsCheck3xMigrationGuide.md for future reference

### BR_013: CI Workflow Fails on Main Branch After Merge
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Markers**: [CI/CD] [WORKFLOW] [BRANCH-PROTECTION]
**Created**: 2025-08-22
**Completed**: 2025-08-22

**What**: CI workflow falsely fails on main branch pushes due to incorrect job dependencies
**Why**: Post-merge CI failures create false alarms and mask real issues
**Root Cause**: `build-and-test` job depends on `branch-freshness`, but `branch-freshness` only runs on PRs (skipped on main), causing `build-and-test` to be skipped, which triggers failure in `ci-status`
**Impact**: Makes it appear that merges are bypassing failing CI when protection is actually working correctly

**How**: 
- Remove `branch-freshness` from `build-and-test` dependencies
- Add conditional logic to only run when `quick-check` succeeds
- Enhanced logging in `ci-status` job for better debugging
- Maintain proper branch protection (only "Build & Test" required for PRs)

**Done When**:
- CI workflow runs successfully on main branch pushes
- `build-and-test` job runs independently of `branch-freshness` 
- Branch protection rules remain intact
- Post-merge CI failures eliminated

**DevOps Engineer Decision** (2025-08-22):
- **FIXED**: Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with corrected dependencies
- **Tested**: Local build passes, workflow logic verified
- **Root cause**: Workflow design flaw, not branch protection issue
- **Impact**: Eliminates false CI failure alarms after legitimate merges
