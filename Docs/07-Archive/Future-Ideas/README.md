# Future Ideas Archive

**Archived**: 2025-08-19
**Reason**: Premature detailed documentation for unvalidated features

## Why These Were Archived

These mechanics documents were created early in the project when we were exploring the full vision. However, they represent:

1. **Unvalidated ideas** - We haven't proven the core game is fun yet
2. **Premature specification** - Too much detail for features 6+ months away
3. **Documentation debt** - Not maintained, create confusion with Vision.md

## What's Here

- `01_Life_Stages.md` - Detailed life stage progression mechanics
- `02_Personality_System.md` - MBTI-based personality development
- `03_Luck_System.md` - Luck and fortune mechanics
- `04_Block_Narratives.md` - Story and narrative systems

## When to Resurrect

These ideas should only be brought back when:
- Core gameplay (VS_003-005) is validated and fun
- Players are asking for more depth
- We have bandwidth to build and maintain these systems
- Playtesting suggests these specific mechanics would enhance the game

## Current Source of Truth

For active game design, see:
- `/Docs/02-Design/Vision.md` - High-level vision and confirmed mechanics
- `/Docs/01-Active/Backlog.md` - What we're actually building

## Note

These aren't bad ideas - they're just premature. Build the fun first, then add depth.
