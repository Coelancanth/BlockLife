# TD_018: Workflows Documentation Reorganization

## Overview
Complete reorganization of the Workflows documentation to improve discoverability and logical grouping.

## Objectives
- [x] Analyze existing workflow file structure
- [x] Create logical subdirectory organization
  - Agent-Workflows/: 11 agent workflow files
  - Orchestration-System/: Orchestration guide, feedback system, testing protocol
  - Dynamic-PO-Pattern/: Pattern documentation and test results
- [x] Move all 17 workflow files to appropriate subdirectories
- [x] Create comprehensive README.md explaining:
  - Folder structure and contents
  - Critical starting points for users
  - Quick reference for agent triggering
  - Common workflow patterns
  - Success metrics and integration points

## Metrics
- Total files reorganized: 17
- New subdirectories created: 3
- README.md created: Yes

## Impact
- Improved documentation discoverability
- Clearer separation of workflow concerns
- Enhanced navigation for developers and AI agents

## Status
- **Type**: Tech Debt
- **Priority**: P1
- **Complexity**: 3-4h
- **Progress**: 100% Complete

## Notes
This reorganization supports the ongoing Automatic Orchestration Pattern implementation by creating a more structured and navigable workflow documentation system.

## Next Steps
- Validate new structure with tech lead
- Update any cross-references to workflow files
- Potentially create a navigation index
