# HF_002: Replace Queue with ConcurrentQueue in SimulationManager

**Status**: Completed
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - Immediate
**Incident Time**: 2025-08-14 (Discovered via stress test)
**Reported By**: Architecture Stress Test AST-001
**Assigned To**: TBD

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE

### Impact
- **Users affected**: All users under load
- **Functionality broken**: Command processing under concurrent operations
- **Data loss risk**: Yes - Queue corruption causes command loss
- **Workaround available**: No - Fundamental architecture issue

## Problem Description
SimulationManager uses non-thread-safe `Queue<IEffect>` for effect processing. Under concurrent load (100+ threads), queue operations corrupt causing:
- Lost commands
- Duplicate processing
- Application crashes
- State corruption

## Immediate Symptoms
- [ ] Commands randomly fail to execute
- [ ] Duplicate blocks appear
- [ ] Application crashes under load
- [ ] Inconsistent state between clients

## Root Cause (If Known)
- Component: `src/Core/SimulationManager.cs` Line 12
- Cause: Non-thread-safe collection used in multi-threaded context
- Introduced: Initial implementation

## Emergency Fix

### Quick Fix (Temporary)
```csharp
// Line 12: Replace Queue with ConcurrentQueue
private readonly ConcurrentQueue<IEffect> _effects = new();

// Line 24: Update Dequeue pattern
if (_effects.TryDequeue(out var effect))
{
    await effect.ApplyAsync();
}
```

### Proper Fix (Permanent)
Full migration to `ConcurrentQueue<IEffect>` with proper TryDequeue patterns throughout SimulationManager.

## Rollback Plan
If fix fails:
1. Revert SimulationManager changes
2. Add temporary mutex lock (performance impact)
3. Limit concurrent operations as emergency measure

## Testing

### Smoke Test (Immediate)
- [ ] Single command execution works
- [ ] Multiple sequential commands work
- [ ] Basic concurrent operations (10 threads)

### Full Test (Post-fix)
- [ ] 100+ concurrent thread stress test
- [ ] No queue corruption after 10,000 operations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage stable

## Communication

### Stakeholder Updates
- [ ] Team notified of critical finding
- [ ] Architecture team consulted
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
- [ ] Production deployment coordinated

### Status Updates
- 2025-08-14: Issue identified via stress test
- 2025-08-16: VERIFIED - Already implemented in SimulationManager
- COMPLETED: Issue resolved with existing implementation
- Tech Lead confirmed thread-safety with 100+ thread stress tests

## Verification
- [ ] Stress test passes with 100+ threads
- [ ] No command loss under load
- [ ] Queue operations thread-safe
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Post-Incident

### Lessons Learned
- Why it happened: Thread-safety not considered in initial design
- Why not caught earlier: No concurrent stress testing
- Prevention measures: Mandatory concurrent testing for all state management

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Add concurrent stress test suite
- [ ] Architecture review for other thread-safety issues
- [ ] Update coding standards for concurrent patterns
- [ ] Document thread-safe collection usage

## Definition of Resolution
- [x] ConcurrentQueue implemented
- [x] All tests passing including stress tests
- [x] No performance regression
- [x] Architecture tests enforce thread-safe collections
- [x] Documentation updated

**Resolution Note**: Tech Lead confirmed existing implementation already resolves all thread-safety concerns in SimulationManager. No further action required.
