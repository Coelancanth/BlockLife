# TD_011: Validation Pipeline Behavior

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Architecture)
**Status**: ✅ OBSOLETE
**Reason**: Superseded by ADR-007 Enhanced Functional Validation Pattern
**Date Archived**: 2025-08-16

## 🚫 Obsolescence Explanation

This work item has been marked as OBSOLETE because the validation strategy proposed here has been replaced by a more comprehensive architectural decision:

- ADR-007 (Enhanced Functional Validation Pattern) was approved on 2025-08-13
- The ADR chose a functional approach over the proposed FluentValidation
- Functional validation patterns will be used instead of pipeline behaviors
- Centralized validation will be implemented using monadic `Fin<T>` validation

## 🔒 Original Scope (For Historical Reference)

### Pipeline Behavior
- ICommandValidator interface
- ValidationBehavior for MediatR
- Validation result types
- Error aggregation

### Validation Infrastructure
- FluentValidation integration
- Custom validation attributes
- Async validation support
- Caching for expensive validations
