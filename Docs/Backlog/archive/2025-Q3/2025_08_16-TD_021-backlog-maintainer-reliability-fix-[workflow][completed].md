# TD_021: Backlog Maintainer Reliability Fix

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt  
**Priority**: P0 (CRITICAL)  
**Created**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

## 🎯 Objective
Fix critical reliability issues in the backlog-maintainer agent that cause false success reports and silent failures during file operations.

## 📝 Problem Statement
The backlog-maintainer agent has excellent verification code (lines 699-735 in workflow) but doesn't actually execute it, leading to:
- False success reports (BF_003, BF_005, BF_006 incidents)
- Files not actually moved when archiving
- Duplicate archive files created
- Silent failures without error messages

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Verification protocol executes after EVERY file operation
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of all operations implemented
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms work on verification failure
- [ ] Self-verification checks prevent false reports
- [ ] 0% false positive rate on file operations
- [ ] All existing BF incidents would be prevented

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Implement Verification Execution
- Ensure verify_file_operation() is called after every operation
- Add mandatory 1-2 second delay for filesystem sync
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

### Phase 2: Add Comprehensive Logging
- Log every operation with timestamp and details
- Create audit trail for debugging
- Add verbose mode for troubleshooting

### Phase 3: Rollback Mechanisms
- Keep backup before operations
- Implement atomic operations where possible
- Add recovery procedures for failures

### Phase 4: Self-Verification
- Add health checks before operations
- Verify agent has necessary permissions
- Test filesystem responsiveness
