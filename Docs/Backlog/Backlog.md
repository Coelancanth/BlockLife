# 📋 Product Backlog - Solo Developer + AI Workflow

**Single Source of Truth for ALL BlockLife Work Items**  
**Maintained by**: Agile Product Owner Agent  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-16  
**Current Focus Session**: ⚠️ WORKFLOW REFACTORING IN PROGRESS

> **WORKFLOW NOTE**: This backlog is designed for ONE DEVELOPER working with Claude and specialized subagents. All items tracked in real-time with focus on deep work and context management.

## 📁 File-Based Work Item Structure

**Organization Pattern:**
- **Active Items**: `items/` folder - Click item IDs to view full details
- **Completed Items**: `archive/YYYY-QN/` - Historical reference (e.g., HF_004 completed in 2025-Q1)
- **This File**: Dynamic tracker showing current status and progress

**How to Use:**
1. Click on any work item ID in the tracker table to view full details
2. Items are self-contained markdown files with complete specifications
3. Status and progress tracked here, details maintained in item files

**Currently Available Files:**
- 📁 `items/`: 7 active work items (HF, TD, VS, BF types)
- 📁 `archive/completed/2025-Q1/`: 15+ completed items

**Items Pending File Creation:**
- VS_001 through VS_003, VS_006 through VS_011 (future features)
- BF_001 (bug fix)

## 🔄 WORKFLOW REFACTORING IN PROGRESS

> **⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE**: We are implementing an Automatic Orchestration Pattern where the Product Owner agent will be AUTOMATICALLY triggered after EVERY agent action to maintain this Backlog as the true Single Source of Truth.

### Active Refactoring Items
- **🔄 IN PROGRESS** TD_021: Implement Automated Verification Pipeline (35% Complete)
- **⏸️ QUEUED** VS_000.3: Resume Move Block Phase 3

**Session Achievements:**
- 🚧 Initiating Automated Verification Pipeline
- 🔄 Cleaned up Work Item Tracker

> **⚠️ WARNING**: Many existing work items may require re-evaluation during this refactor. The workflow patterns, agent responsibilities, and synchronization mechanisms are being fundamentally restructured to ensure the PO maintains real-time state synchronization across ALL project changes.

## 🔄 Solo Workflow Process

1. **Session Start**: Pick ONE item to focus on
2. **Deep Work**: Stay on item until natural break point
3. **Test Continuously**: Use `test-watch.bat` for auto-feedback
4. **Agent Assistance**: Call specific subagent when needed
5. **Session End**: Complete or reach good stopping point
6. **Document**: Update this backlog with progress
7. **Plan Next**: Queue up next session's work

**Key Principles**:
- ONE active item at a time (minimize WIP)
- Complete phases before switching context
- Use agents for expertise, not basic tasks
- Automate repetitive work with scripts
- Track focus time and context switches
