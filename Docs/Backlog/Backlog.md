# 📋 Product Backlog - Solo Developer + AI Workflow

**Single Source of Truth for ALL BlockLife Work Items**  
**Maintained by**: Agile Product Owner Agent  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-15  
**Current Focus Session**: ⚠️ WORKFLOW REFACTORING IN PROGRESS

> **WORKFLOW NOTE**: This backlog is designed for ONE DEVELOPER working with Claude and specialized subagents. All items tracked in real-time with focus on deep work and context management.

## 📁 File-Based Work Item Structure

**Organization Pattern:**
- **Active Items**: `items/` folder - Click item IDs to view full details
- **Completed Items**: `archive/YYYY-QN/` - Historical reference (e.g., HF_004 completed in 2025-Q1)
- **This File**: Dynamic tracker showing current status and progress

**How to Use:**
1. Click on any work item ID in the tracker table to view full details
2. Items are self-contained markdown files with complete specifications
3. Status and progress tracked here, details maintained in item files

**Currently Available Files:**
- 📁 `items/`: 15 active work items (HF, TD, VS types)
- 📁 `archive/completed/2025-Q1/`: 1 completed item (HF_004)

**Items Pending File Creation:**
- TD_012 through TD_015 (new workflow refactoring items)
- VS_001 through VS_003, VS_006 through VS_011 (future features)
- BF_001 (bug fix)

## 🔄 WORKFLOW REFACTORING IN PROGRESS

> **⚠️ CRITICAL CHANGE**: We are implementing a Dynamic PO Pattern where the Product Owner agent will be AUTOMATICALLY triggered after EVERY agent action to maintain this Backlog as the true Single Source of Truth.

### Active Refactoring Items
- **🔄 REFACTOR** TD_012: Dynamic PO Pattern Implementation (P0 - CRITICAL)
- **🔄 REFACTOR** TD_013: CLAUDE.md Workflow Documentation Update (P0 - CRITICAL) 
- **🔄 REFACTOR** TD_014: Agent Architecture Pattern Update (P1 - HIGH)
- **🔄 REFACTOR** TD_015: PO Trigger Points Documentation (P1 - HIGH)

> **⚠️ WARNING**: Many existing work items may require re-evaluation during this refactor. The workflow patterns, agent responsibilities, and synchronization mechanisms are being fundamentally restructured to ensure the PO maintains real-time state synchronization across ALL project changes.

## 🤖 Agent Recommendations

### Current Session Support
- **Active Agent**: `implementation-planner` - Guiding Move Block Phase 3
- **On Standby**: `code-review-expert` - Ready for phase completion review

### Priority Recommendations by Agents
| Agent | Recommends | Rationale |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| **tech-lead-advisor** | HF_002, HF_003, TD_002 | Critical stability issues that could corrupt data |
| **architecture-stress-tester** | TD_003, TD_005 | No stress testing = hidden production failures |
| **code-review-expert** | TD_001 | Notification pipeline needs cleanup |
| **implementation-planner** | Complete VS_000.3 first | Maintain focus, finish what's started |

### Automation Opportunities
- ✅ **Implemented**: `test-watch.bat` - Auto-runs tests every 10s
- ✅ **Implemented**: Git hooks prevent main branch work
- 🎯 **Suggested**: Script to auto-generate vertical slice boilerplate
- 🎯 **Suggested**: Automated stress test runner for critical paths
- 🎯 **Suggested**: Command to scaffold new features with all layers

## 📈 Solo Developer Metrics

### Focus Metrics
```
Context Switches:    █░░░░░░░░░ 0 today (excellent!)
WIP Items:          █░░░░░░░░░ 1 (optimal)
Completed Today:    ██████░░░░ 2 phases
```

### Session Distribution
```
Feature Work:    ████████░░░░░░ 60% (Move Block)
Critical Fixes:  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (queued for next)
Tech Debt:       ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 0% (after fixes)
Documentation:   ████░░░░░░░░░░ 20% (ongoing)
Testing:         ████░░░░░░░░░░ 20% (TDD cycle)
```

### Cognitive Load Management
- **Current Load**: MODERATE (single complex feature)
- **Recommended**: Complete Phase 3 before context switch
- **Next Session**: Quick fixes (HF_002, HF_003) - 2-3h total
- **Avoid**: Starting new features until critical fixes done

## 🔄 Solo Workflow Process

1. **Session Start**: Pick ONE item to focus on
2. **Deep Work**: Stay on item until natural break point
3. **Test Continuously**: Use `test-watch.bat` for auto-feedback
4. **Agent Assistance**: Call specific subagent when needed
5. **Session End**: Complete or reach good stopping point
6. **Document**: Update this backlog with progress
7. **Plan Next**: Queue up next session's work

**Key Principles**:
- ONE active item at a time (minimize WIP)
- Complete phases before switching context
- Use agents for expertise, not basic tasks
- Automate repetitive work with scripts
- Track focus time and context switches
