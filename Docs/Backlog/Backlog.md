# BlockLife Development Backlog

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-17

## ðŸ”¥ Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

- Fix critical bugs in Grid State
- Complete Move Block feature (Phase 1) dependencies

## ðŸ“ˆ Important (Do Next)  
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

- Implement Block Rotation system
- Begin Save/Load system design
- Animation queuing system implementation
- Performance optimization for grid operations

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas (Do Later)
*Nice-to-have features, experimental concepts, future considerations*

- Multiplayer support exploration
- Custom block shapes system
- Level editor prototype
- Audio system integration (waiting for Godot 4.4)

## âœ… Done This Week
- ~~Move Block feature (Phase 1) core implementation~~
- ~~VSA refactoring cleanup~~
- ~~Agent ecosystem documentation review~~
- ~~MAJOR: Documentation consolidation - 76 files â†’ Essential Three system~~
- ~~Workflow transformation - intelligent orchestration with complexity-based delegation~~
- ~~CLAUDE.md update - added critical thinking mandate and over-engineering safeguards~~

## ðŸš§ Currently Blocked
- Audio system implementation (external dependency: Godot 4.4)
