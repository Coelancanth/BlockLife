# TD_023: Agent Ecosystem Refinements

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt  
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)  
**Created**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours

## 🎯 Objective
Apply refinements across multiple agents to improve consistency, add missing patterns, and enhance overall ecosystem effectiveness.

## 📝 Problem Statement
Several agents have minor gaps that, while not critical, would significantly improve the ecosystem:
- Commands use bash instead of PowerShell (Windows environment)
- Missing Godot-specific automation and refactoring patterns
- No visual testing capabilities
- Limited metrics and tracking

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### DevOps Engineer
- [ ] .tscn/.tres file automation scripts added
- [ ] Godot export automation pipelines created
- [ ] Scene validation scripts implemented
- [ ] Docker/devcontainer setup included

### Git Expert
- [ ] PowerShell equivalents for all commands
- [ ] Windows-specific path handling added
- [ ] Conflict visualization patterns

### QA Engineer
- [ ] Visual regression testing patterns added
- [ ] Test data generation templates
- [ ] Performance profiling patterns

### VSA Refactoring
- [ ] Node composition refactoring patterns
- [ ] Scene structure refactoring added
- [ ] Resource organization patterns

### Product Owner
- [ ] Velocity tracking metrics
- [ ] Burndown visualization
- [ ] Risk scoring matrix

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

### Phase 1: PowerShell Standardization
- Convert all bash commands to PowerShell
- Add Windows path handling
- Test on Windows 10 environment

### Phase 2: Godot Automation
- Create scene manipulation scripts
- Add resource validation tools
- Implement export automation

### Phase 3: Testing Enhancements
- Add visual testing framework
- Create test data generators
- Implement performance profiling

### Phase 4: Metrics & Tracking
- Build velocity tracking
- Create visualization templates
- Add risk assessment tools
