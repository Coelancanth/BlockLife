# TD_014: Agent Architecture Pattern Update

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Architecture Documentation)
**Status**: 60% Complete (Definitions Created)
**Priority**: P1 - High
**Size**: M (3-4 hours)
**Started**: 2025-08-15

## 📝 Description
Update agent architecture patterns to support the Automatic Orchestration Pattern, including agent definitions, communication patterns, and the orchestrator-interpreter model.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
- **Problem**: Agent communication was a "black box" to users
- **Impact**: Confusion about how agents work and communicate
- **Solution**: Transparent documentation of agent mechanics

## ✅ Completed (60%)
- [x] Created product-owner agent definition
- [x] Created backlog-maintainer agent definition
- [x] Documented orchestrator-interpreter pattern
- [x] Added visibility testing examples
- [x] Explained why main agent "retells" responses

### Key Documentation Added
- **The Orchestrator-Interpreter Pattern** section
- Raw vs interpreted response examples
- Visibility testing protocol
- Agent creativity demonstration

## 🔄 Remaining Work (40%)
- [ ] **Complete agent registration**
  - [ ] Register new agents with system
  - [ ] Test agent selection by description
  - [ ] Verify proactive triggering
  
- [ ] **Document all agent types**
  - [ ] Create definitions for planned agents
  - [ ] Update agent capability matrix
  - [ ] Define agent boundaries
  
- [ ] **Create agent testing suite**
  - [ ] Test workflow adherence
  - [ ] Verify agent responses
  - [ ] Validate trigger patterns

## 📊 Technical Design

### Agent Communication Flow
```
User Request
    ↓
Main Agent (interprets)
    ↓
Subagent (executes with workflow)
    ↓
Raw Response (full detail)
    ↓
Main Agent (synthesizes)
    ↓
User (sees integrated response)
```

### Transparency Levels
1. **Interpreted** (default) - Synthesized response
2. **Raw** - Complete subagent output
3. **Both** - Shows interpretation process
4. **Debug** - Full communication trace

## 🚧 Current Status
- Agent definitions created but not registered
- Communication patterns documented
- Testing protocol established
- Integration pending

## 📚 References
- [Agent Architecture](../../1_Architecture/Agent_Architecture_and_Workflow_Patterns.md)
- [Agent Definitions](.claude/agents/)
- [Test Results](../../../test_subagent_response.md)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All agents properly defined
- [ ] Communication transparent
- [ ] Testing suite functional
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Proactive triggering works

## 📝 Notes
The orchestrator-interpreter pattern revelation was crucial - it explains why the main agent synthesizes responses rather than just passing them through. This transparency helps users understand the system better.
