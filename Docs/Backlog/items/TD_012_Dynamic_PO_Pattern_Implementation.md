# TD_012: Dynamic PO Pattern Implementation

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Workflow Refactoring)
**Status**: 80% Complete (Integration Pending)
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL (Active Now)
**Size**: L (4-6 hours total)
**Started**: 2025-08-15

## 📝 Description
Implement the Dynamic Product Owner Pattern where the PO agent is automatically triggered after EVERY development action to maintain the Backlog as the Single Source of Truth.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
- **Problem**: Manual backlog updates lead to drift and inconsistency
- **Impact**: Lost work items, unclear priorities, context confusion
- **Solution**: Automatic state synchronization through agent orchestration

## ✅ Completed (80%)
- [x] Designed hybrid workflow architecture
- [x] Created product-owner workflow definition
- [x] Created backlog-maintainer workflow definition
- [x] Established agent definitions in .claude/agents/
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with workflow patterns
- [x] Tested agent responses and creativity
- [x] Documented orchestrator-interpreter pattern

## 🔄 Remaining Work (20%)
- [ ] **Implement automatic triggering mechanism**
  - [ ] Define all trigger points
  - [ ] Create integration code in CLAUDE.md
  - [ ] Add proactive invocation patterns
  
- [ ] **Create trigger documentation**
  - [ ] List all development actions
  - [ ] Map to appropriate agent
  - [ ] Define silent vs visible updates
  
- [ ] **Test end-to-end flow**
  - [ ] Feature request → PO → Backlog update
  - [ ] Code completion → Maintainer → Progress update
  - [ ] Bug found → PO → BF creation

## 📊 Technical Design

### Trigger Points
```python
# After ANY of these actions:
- User describes feature → product-owner (visible)
- Code implementation done → backlog-maintainer (silent)
- Tests written → backlog-maintainer (silent)
- Bug discovered → product-owner (visible)
- Work item completed → backlog-maintainer (silent)
- Session ends → product-owner (weekly planning)
```

### Integration Pattern
```python
def after_action(action_type, context):
    if action_type in ['feature_request', 'bug_found']:
        invoke_agent('product-owner', action_type, context, visible=True)
    elif action_type in ['code_done', 'tests_written', 'item_complete']:
        invoke_agent('backlog-maintainer', action_type, context, silent=True)
```

## 🚧 Blockers
- Agent registration system doesn't recognize new agents yet
- Need system-level update for new agent types

## 📚 References
- [Agent Architecture](../../1_Architecture/Agent_Architecture_and_Workflow_Patterns.md)
- [Product Owner Workflow](../../Workflows/product-owner-workflow.md)
- [Backlog Maintainer Workflow](../../Workflows/backlog-maintainer-workflow.md)

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PO automatically invoked on feature requests
- [ ] Backlog updates without manual intervention
- [ ] Progress tracked accurately in real-time
- [ ] No manual "update backlog" tasks needed
- [ ] Clear audit trail of decisions

## 📝 Notes
This is a fundamental workflow change that affects how all future development is tracked and managed. Must be completed before resuming feature work.
