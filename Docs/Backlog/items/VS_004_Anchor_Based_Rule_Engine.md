# VS_004: Anchor-Based Rule Engine

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Vertical Slice (Feature)
**Status**: Architecture Approved, Not Started
**Priority**: P3 (After core features)
**Size**: XL (5-6 weeks)

## 📝 Description
Implement an anchor-based rule evaluation engine for efficient pattern matching and chain reactions in the game grid. This replaces inefficient grid-scanning with targeted pattern evaluation.

## 🎯 Business Value
- **Performance**: 150x improvement (0.3ms vs 45ms evaluation)
- **Scalability**: Handles larger grids efficiently
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new patterns and rules
- **Designer-Friendly**: Visual pattern creation tools

## 📐 Architecture
- IAnchorPattern interface and core types
- IRuleEvaluationEngine with pattern registration
- PatternBuilder for declarative pattern creation
- Chain reaction system with cycle detection
- Spatial indexing integration

## 🔄 Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1)
- IAnchorPattern, IRuleEvaluationEngine
- Basic pattern registration and evaluation
- Unit tests for core functionality

### Phase 2: Hybrid Optimization (Week 2)
- Spatial indexing integration
- Performance monitoring and metrics
- Benchmark tests

### Phase 3: Pattern Library (Week 3)
- BlockLife-specific patterns (T-5, T-4, L-shapes)
- Adjacency and proximity patterns
- Pattern composition

### Phase 4: Chain Reactions (Week 4)
- ChainReactionProcessor implementation
- Cycle detection and prevention
- Complex interaction tests

### Phase 5: Designer Tools (Week 5)
- Visual pattern builder UI
- Pattern testing and validation tools
- Documentation and examples
