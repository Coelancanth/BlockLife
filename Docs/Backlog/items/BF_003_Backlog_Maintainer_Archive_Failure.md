# BF_003: Backlog Maintainer Archive Failure

## Bug Summary
Silent failures in backlog item archiving due to archive path mismatch

## Detailed Problem Description
The backlog maintainer's archiving mechanism is experiencing silent failures when attempting to move completed work items to the archive directory. This is causing potential loss of historical work tracking and incomplete documentation.

## Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Archive path missing `/completed/` subdirectory (was `archive/YYYY-QN/`, should be `archive/completed/YYYY-QN/`)
- **Current Status**: FIXED and VERIFIED
- **Resolution**: Updated backlog-maintainer-workflow.md with correct paths and verification steps

## Diagnostic Information
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Completed items not moving to archive
  - No error logs generated
  - Inconsistent state tracking

## Fix Requirements
1. Validate archive path resolution mechanism
2. Implement robust error handling
3. Add comprehensive logging for archive operations
4. Create test suite to verify archiving functionality across different scenarios

## Proposed Solution
- Refactor path resolution logic in backlog maintainer
- Implement strict error checking and logging
- Add validation for archive destination before moving items
- Create comprehensive test coverage for archiving process

## Progress Tracking
- [x] Identify root cause of path mismatch (missing `/completed/` in path)
- [x] Develop fix for path resolution (updated workflow line 236)
- [x] Implement logging and error handling (added verification steps)
- [x] Create test suite for archive mechanism (verify_agent_output.py)
- [x] Verify fix across multiple scenarios (successfully archived 5 items)

## Complexity and Effort
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Complexity**: Moderate (requires careful path handling)
- **Priority**: High (critical to workflow tracking)

- Automatic Orchestration Pattern
- Backlog Maintainer Workflow
- Documentation Tracking System

## Potential Risks
- Incomplete migration of historical work items
- Potential data loss if not addressed
- Disruption to automated tracking mechanisms
