# TD_006: Advanced Logger & GameStrapper

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Infrastructure)
**Status**: Not Started
**Priority**: P4 (Infrastructure improvement)
**Size**: M (1-2 weeks)

## 📝 Description
Enhance the logging infrastructure and GameStrapper configuration for better debugging, monitoring, and development experience.

## 🎯 Business Value
- **Debugging**: Faster issue identification
- **Monitoring**: Better production insights
- **Development**: Improved developer experience
- **Performance**: Optimized logging paths

## 📐 Scope

### Advanced Logger
- Structured logging enhancements
- Performance profiling integration
- Log aggregation and filtering
- Conditional compilation for release builds
- Memory-efficient circular buffers

### GameStrapper Improvements
- Enhanced DI configuration
- Environment-based settings
- Startup performance optimization
- Better error messages for DI issues
- Configuration validation

## 🔄 Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Logger Core
- [ ] Implement circular buffer for in-memory logs
- [ ] Add performance timing decorators
- [ ] Create log context enrichment
- [ ] Add structured log queries

### Phase 2: GameStrapper
- [ ] Refactor DI registration patterns
- [ ] Add configuration validation
- [ ] Implement environment switching
- [ ] Improve startup diagnostics

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Connect logger to UI overlay
- [ ] Add developer console commands
- [ ] Create log export functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
