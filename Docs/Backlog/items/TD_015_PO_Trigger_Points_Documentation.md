# TD_015: PO Trigger Points Documentation

## üìã Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Documentation)
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE (100%)
**Priority**: P1 - High
**Size**: S (2 hours)
**Started**: 2025-08-15
**Completed**: 2025-08-16

## üìù Description
Document all trigger points where the Product Owner or Backlog Maintainer agents should be automatically invoked during development workflow.

## üéØ Why This Matters
- **Problem**: Unclear when agents should be triggered
- **Impact**: Manual invocation, missed updates, inconsistent tracking
- **Solution**: Comprehensive trigger point documentation

## ‚úÖ Completed (100%)
- [x] Basic trigger categories identified
- [x] Silent vs visible update distinction made
- [x] Initial mapping created
- [x] **Complete trigger mapping**
  - [x] Listed ALL development actions
  - [x] Mapped each to appropriate agent
  - [x] Defined visibility level
  - [x] Specified context needed
  
- [x] **Created trigger documentation**
  - [x] Wrote comprehensive guide (PO_TRIGGER_POINTS.md)
  - [x] Added to CLAUDE.md
  - [x] Created quick reference (PO_TRIGGER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)
  
- [x] **Implemented trigger patterns**
  - [x] Added to orchestration guide
  - [x] Documented trigger code patterns
  - [x] Created validation checklist

## üìä Trigger Point Mapping

### Product Owner Triggers (Visible)
| Action | Trigger | Context Needed | Output |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| User describes feature | "I want to add X" | Feature description, current priorities | User story or deferral |
| Bug discovered | Error/issue found | Bug details, severity | BF item creation |
| Acceptance review | Work completed | Work item, test results | Accept/reject decision |
| Priority conflict | Multiple urgent items | Conflicting items | Priority decision |
| Session planning | Session start/end | Current backlog state | Session goals |

### Backlog Maintainer Triggers (Silent)
| Action | Trigger | Context Needed | Output |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Code written | File saved/created | Files changed, feature | Progress update |
| Tests written | Test file created | Test coverage, type | Progress update |
| Tests passing | Test run success | Test results | Status update |
| PR created | Git PR command | PR details, changes | Item status change |
| PR merged | Merge complete | Merged items | Archive completed |
| Session end | Time-based | Session work | Progress summary |

### Special Triggers
| Action | Trigger | Agent | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| Critical error | Exception/crash | product-owner | Create HF immediately |
| Performance issue | Slow operation | architecture-stress-tester | Then PO for prioritization |
| Architecture violation | Test failure | code-reviewer | Then PO if needs TD item |

## üöß Implementation Status
- Basic structure defined
- Need to code actual triggers
- Integration with CLAUDE.md pending

## üìö References
- [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md)
- [Product Owner Workflow](../../Workflows/product-owner-workflow.md)
- [Backlog Maintainer Workflow](../../Workflows/backlog-maintainer-workflow.md)

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All trigger points documented (7 major categories with subcategories)
- [x] Clear mapping table created (comprehensive patterns for each trigger type)
- [x] Implementation code provided (Python patterns in orchestration guide)
- [x] Testing protocol defined (validation checklist and metrics)
- [x] Quick reference available (PO_TRIGGER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md)

## üìù Notes
This documentation is critical for making the Automatic Orchestration Pattern actually work. Without clear triggers, the pattern remains theoretical rather than practical.

## üéâ Completion Summary
Successfully created comprehensive Product Owner trigger documentation that ensures the Backlog remains the Single Source of Truth. The documentation includes:

1. **Main Documentation** (`PO_TRIGGER_POINTS.md`): 
   - Complete catalog of all trigger patterns
   - Priority rules and edge cases
   - Integration patterns with other agents
   - Metrics and troubleshooting guide

2. **Quick Reference** (`PO_TRIGGER_QUICK_REFERENCE.md`):
   - Instant trigger guide for developers
   - Clear always/consider/don't rules
   - Priority ordering for multiple triggers

3. **Integration Updates**:
   - Updated main orchestration guide
   - Enhanced product owner workflow
   - Added references to CLAUDE.md

This completes the Product Owner trigger documentation, providing clear, actionable guidance for automatic orchestration.
