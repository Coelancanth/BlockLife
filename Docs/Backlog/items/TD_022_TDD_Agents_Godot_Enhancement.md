# TD_022: TDD Agents Godot Enhancement

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt  
**Priority**: P1 (High)  
**Created**: 2025-08-16  
**Status**: Ready  
**Estimated Effort**: 16-20 hours

## 🎯 Objective
Enhance test-designer and dev-engineer agents with Godot-specific patterns to improve TDD cycle effectiveness for Godot/C# development.

## 📝 Problem Statement
The TDD agents (test-designer and dev-engineer) have strong C# patterns but lack Godot-specific knowledge:
- No GdUnit4 test design patterns
- Missing Godot node implementation examples
- No stress test templates for Godot scenarios
- Limited signal/event wiring patterns

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Test-Designer Enhancements
- [ ] GdUnit4 test pattern templates added
- [ ] Stress test design for 100+ concurrent operations
- [ ] Godot node lifecycle test patterns
- [ ] Property-based testing for Godot types
- [ ] Scene testing patterns documented

### Dev-Engineer Enhancements
- [ ] Godot node implementation patterns added
- [ ] Signal/event wiring examples included
- [ ] Scene manipulation code patterns
- [ ] More LanguageExt patterns (Option<T>, Either<L,R>)
- [ ] Thread marshalling patterns for Godot

## 🏗️ Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Test-Designer Godot Patterns
- Add GdUnit4 test templates to workflow
- Create stress test scenarios for Godot
- Document node lifecycle testing
- Add scene testing patterns

### Phase 2: Dev-Engineer Implementation Patterns
- Add Godot node patterns to workflow
- Include signal wiring examples
- Add CallDeferred patterns
- Include scene tree manipulation

### Phase 3: Integration Testing
- Verify patterns work together
- Test TDD cycle with new patterns
- Update reference documentation

### Phase 4: Documentation
- Update agent references
- Add examples to workflows
- Create pattern library
