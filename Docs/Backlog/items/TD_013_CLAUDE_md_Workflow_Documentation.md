# TD_013: CLAUDE.md Workflow Documentation Update

## 📋 Overview
**Type**: Tech Debt (Documentation)
**Status**: ✅ 100% Complete
**Priority**: P0 - CRITICAL
**Size**: M (2-3 hours)
**Completed**: 2025-08-15

## 📝 Description
Update CLAUDE.md with comprehensive workflow documentation for the Automatic Orchestration Pattern, including agent orchestration, trigger points, and integration patterns.

## 🎯 Why This Matters
- **Problem**: CLAUDE.md had scattered agent instructions without clear workflow
- **Impact**: Inconsistent agent usage, manual processes
- **Solution**: Centralized workflow orchestration in CLAUDE.md

## ✅ Completed Work (100%)

### Documentation Added
- [x] Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration section
- [x] Hybrid workflow architecture explanation
- [x] Agent invocation patterns
- [x] Workflow file references
- [x] Standard trigger patterns
- [x] Integration examples

### Key Sections Created
```markdown
## Multi-Agent Workflow Orchestration

### Automatic Orchestration Pattern
When user performs ANY development action:
1. Main agent detects action type
2. Invokes appropriate subagent with workflow
3. Subagent reads workflow file
4. Executes workflow steps
5. Returns result for integration
```

### Files Updated
- ✅ CLAUDE.md - Added complete workflow section
- ✅ Created standard invocation pattern
- ✅ Defined workflow file structure
- ✅ Added agent trigger mapping

## 📊 Implementation Details

### Standard Pattern Established
```python
def trigger_agent(agent_type, action, context):
    Task(
        description=f"{action} action",
        prompt=f"""
        Read your workflow at: Docs/Workflows/{agent_type}-workflow.md
        Execute action: {action}
        Context: {context}
        """,
        subagent_type=agent_type
    )
```

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met
- ✅ Clear workflow documentation in CLAUDE.md
- ✅ Agent invocation patterns defined
- ✅ Workflow file references included
- ✅ Integration points documented
- ✅ Examples provided

## 📚 References
- [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) - Main documentation
- [Agent Architecture](../../1_Architecture/Agent_Architecture_and_Workflow_Patterns.md)
- [Workflows Directory](../../Workflows/)

## 📝 Notes
This documentation serves as the foundation for all future agent interactions. The hybrid workflow approach allows flexibility while maintaining consistency.
