# BF_001: View Layer Lag Investigation

**Type**: Bug Fix  
**Priority**: üî• Critical  
**Severity**: High  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Found In**: 2025-08-17  
**Reported By**: User

---

## üêõ Problem Description
Block movement commands execute in 0-4ms but user still experiences noticeable lag during block interactions. Despite successful reflection removal optimization, visual feedback feels sluggish.

**Impact**: Poor user experience during core gameplay interaction - block movement feels unresponsive despite fast backend processing.

---

## üîç Reproduction Steps
1. Click to select a block
2. Click destination to move block
3. **Expected**: Immediate visual response
4. **Actual**: Noticeable delay in visual feedback despite fast command completion

**Log Evidence**: 
```
[03:18:27 Information] ["Commands"] "MoveBlockCommand" SUCCESS in 0ms
```

---

## üéØ Root Cause & Fix
**Component Affected**: View layer - likely BlockVisualizationController or Godot node operations

**Root Cause**: Unknown - requires investigation of visual pipeline

**Fix Approach**: Profile view layer operations to identify bottleneck

**Files to Investigate**: 
- `godot_project/features/block/placement/BlockVisualizationController.cs` - Visual updates
- `godot_project/features/block/input/BlockInputManager.cs` - Input handling timing
- Godot node operations and scene tree updates

---

## üß™ Testing Requirements
**Regression Test**: Performance measurement of visual feedback timing

**Additional Testing**:
- [ ] Measure time from input to visual update
- [ ] Profile BlockVisualizationController operations
- [ ] Check Godot scene tree update timing

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Visual feedback responds within acceptable time (target: <16ms for 60fps)
- [ ] Block movement feels responsive to user
- [ ] No regression in command execution performance
- [ ] Performance metrics documented

## üìù Progress & Notes

**Current Status**: **EVIDENCE IDENTIFIED** - First-click initialization lag (282ms) in OnCellClicked_Total

**Console Evidence Analysis**:
```
[03:33:45] "üî¥" "OnCellClicked_Total" took 282ms  ‚Üê PROBLEM: First click lag
[03:33:56] "üü¢" "OnCellClicked_Total" took 0ms   ‚Üê Normal: Subsequent clicks
```

**Root Cause**: NOT animation timing (as previously assumed) but first-click initialization bottleneck

**Agent Updates**:
- 2025-08-17 - Main Agent: Completed TD_002 reflection removal, user reports lag still present
- 2025-08-17 - debugger-expert: **FALSE RESOLUTION** - implemented animation changes without analyzing evidence
- 2025-08-17 - User: Provided console output showing 282ms first-click lag in OnCellClicked
- 2025-08-17 - Main Agent: Real evidence shows initialization problem, not animation problem

**Blockers**: Need proper evidence-based debugging (TD_005) before re-investigation
