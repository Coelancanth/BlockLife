# HF_003: Add Rollback Verification in GridStateService.MoveBlock

**Status**: Ready
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Priority**: P0 - Immediate
**Incident Time**: 2025-08-14 (Discovered via stress test)
**Reported By**: Architecture Stress Test AST-001
**Assigned To**: TBD

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE

### Impact
- **Users affected**: All users performing block moves
- **Functionality broken**: Move operation state consistency
- **Data loss risk**: Yes - Silent state corruption
- **Workaround available**: No - Core functionality issue

## Problem Description
GridStateService.MoveBlock performs rollback on failure but doesn't verify rollback success. If rollback fails (e.g., concurrent modification), system enters corrupted state with:
- Block exists in both old and new positions
- Block missing from both positions
- Inconsistent state across queries

## Immediate Symptoms
- [ ] Blocks appear in multiple positions
- [ ] Blocks disappear after failed moves
- [ ] Grid queries return inconsistent results
- [ ] Validation passes on corrupted state

## Root Cause (If Known)
- Component: `src/Features/Grid/GridStateService.cs` Lines 78-82
- Cause: No verification after rollback attempt
- Introduced: Initial implementation of move logic

## Emergency Fix

### Quick Fix (Temporary)
```csharp
// After rollback attempt (Line 82)
if (!_blocks.TryAdd(from, block))
{
    // CRITICAL: Rollback failed - log and throw
    _logger.Error("CRITICAL: Rollback failed for block {Id} at {From}", 
                  block.Id, from);
    throw new InvalidOperationException(
        $"State corruption: Failed to rollback block {block.Id}");
}
```

### Proper Fix (Permanent)
Implement transactional state changes with verified rollback:
1. Snapshot state before operation
2. Apply changes
3. On failure, restore from snapshot
4. Verify restoration matches snapshot
5. Throw critical error if verification fails

## Rollback Plan
If fix fails:
1. Disable move operations temporarily
2. Add global lock for move operations (performance impact)
3. Implement state validation after each operation

## Testing

### Smoke Test (Immediate)
- [ ] Basic move succeeds
- [ ] Failed move triggers rollback
- [ ] Rollback verification catches failures

### Full Test (Post-fix)
- [ ] Concurrent move operations stress test
- [ ] Forced rollback failure scenarios
- [ ] State consistency validation
- [ ] Recovery from corruption scenarios

## Communication

### Stakeholder Updates
- [ ] Team notified of state corruption risk
- [ ] Data integrity team involved
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Monitoring enhanced

### Status Updates
- 2025-08-14: Silent corruption risk identified
- [Pending]: Rollback verification implemented
- [Pending]: Stress testing complete
- [Pending]: Production deployment

## Verification
- [ ] All rollbacks verified successful
- [ ] No silent state corruption
- [ ] Failed rollbacks throw exceptions
- [ ] State consistency maintained

## Post-Incident

### Lessons Learned
- Why it happened: Assumed rollback always succeeds
- Why not caught earlier: No rollback failure testing
- Prevention measures: Mandatory verification for all state mutations

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Add rollback failure tests
- [ ] Implement state consistency checks
- [ ] Add transaction pattern for complex operations
- [ ] Create state corruption detection tools

## Definition of Resolution
- [ ] Rollback verification implemented
- [ ] No silent failures possible
- [ ] State corruption detection in place
- [ ] Recovery procedures documented
- [ ] Tests cover failure scenarios
