# HF_005: Add Mutex Protection to SceneRoot Singleton

**Status**: Ready
**Severity**: CRITICAL
**Priority**: P1 - High
**Incident Time**: 2025-08-14 (Discovered via stress test)
**Reported By**: Architecture Stress Test AST-001
**Assigned To**: TBD

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE

### Impact
- **Users affected**: All users during scene transitions
- **Functionality broken**: Dependency injection container duplication
- **Data loss risk**: Yes - State split across containers
- **Workaround available**: No - Core initialization issue

## Problem Description
SceneRoot singleton initialization has race condition during Godot scene transitions. Multiple threads can pass null check simultaneously, creating duplicate DI containers causing:
- Commands go to different container than queries
- State inconsistency
- "Phantom blocks" that exist in one container but not another
- Integration test failures

## Immediate Symptoms
- [ ] Duplicate SceneRoot instances created
- [ ] Commands succeed but state doesn't change
- [ ] Queries return stale/wrong data
- [ ] Integration tests fail mysteriously

## Root Cause (If Known)
- Component: `SceneRoot.cs` Lines 19-30 (_Ready method)
- Cause: Non-atomic singleton initialization
- Introduced: Initial SceneRoot implementation

## Emergency Fix

### Quick Fix (Temporary)
```csharp
private static readonly object _initLock = new object();
private static SceneRoot? _instance;

public override void _Ready()
{
    lock (_initLock)
    {
        if (_instance != null && _instance != this)
        {
            GD.PrintErr("Duplicate SceneRoot detected!");
            QueueFree();
            return;
        }
        _instance = this;
        // Rest of initialization...
    }
}
```

### Proper Fix (Permanent)
Implement thread-safe lazy initialization with double-check locking pattern and proper memory barriers.

## Rollback Plan
If fix fails:
1. Add scene transition delays (UX impact)
2. Force synchronous scene loading
3. Disable concurrent scene operations

## Testing

### Smoke Test (Immediate)
- [ ] Single scene load works
- [ ] Scene transitions work
- [ ] No duplicate instances

### Full Test (Post-fix)
- [ ] Concurrent scene transition stress test
- [ ] Race condition detection tests
- [ ] DI container uniqueness validation
- [ ] Integration test stability

## Communication

### Stakeholder Updates
- [ ] Team notified of initialization race condition
- [ ] Integration test failures explained
- [ ] Scene loading changes communicated
- [ ] Testing strategy updated

### Status Updates
- 2025-08-14: Race condition identified
- [Pending]: Mutex protection added
- [Pending]: Stress testing complete
- [Pending]: Integration tests stabilized

## Verification
- [ ] Only one SceneRoot instance ever exists
- [ ] DI container is singleton
- [ ] Scene transitions thread-safe
- [ ] Integration tests pass consistently

## Post-Incident

### Lessons Learned
- Why it happened: Godot's _Ready not thread-safe by default
- Why not caught earlier: Race conditions rare without stress
- Prevention measures: Thread-safe singleton patterns

### Follow-up Actions
- [ ] Add singleton verification tests
- [ ] Review all singleton patterns
- [ ] Document Godot threading model
- [ ] Add scene transition stress tests
- [ ] Update initialization patterns

## Definition of Resolution
- [ ] Thread-safe initialization implemented
- [ ] No duplicate instances possible
- [ ] Integration tests stable
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Pattern documented
