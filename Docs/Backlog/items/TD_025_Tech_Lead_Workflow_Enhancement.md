# TD_025: Tech-Lead Workflow Enhancement

## Overview
Comprehensive improvement of the tech-lead workflow to strengthen our Godot-specific technical decision framework and agent infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Enhance Godot-specific technical decision tracking
- Implement work-in-progress (WIP) awareness
- Create learning feedback system for estimate tracking
- Add Architecture Decision Record (ADR) creation triggers
- Strengthen test-first development planning

## Workflow Improvements
### 1. Godot-Specific Technical Decisions
- Created framework for tracking Godot-specific architectural choices
- Integrated context-aware decision logging
- Enhanced traceability for game development patterns

### 2. WIP Awareness
- Added granular tracking of in-progress work items
- Implemented more detailed progress percentage tracking
- Created mechanism to prevent context switching

### 3. Learning Feedback System
- Established estimate tracking mechanism
- Created system to capture and analyze estimation accuracy
- Developed mechanism for continuous improvement of planning estimates

### 4. ADR Creation Triggers
- Defined clear triggers for creating Architecture Decision Records
- Integrated ADR creation into the existing workflow
- Ensured comprehensive documentation of key architectural decisions

### 5. Test-First Development Planning
- Strengthened test design and implementation guidelines
- Created more robust test planning templates
- Enhanced test coverage tracking mechanisms

## Impact
- Reduced cognitive load in technical decision making
- Improved accuracy of project estimates
- Enhanced documentation and traceability
- More systematic approach to technical debt management

## Status
- **Current Status**: Completed
- **Complexity**: 4-6 hours
- **Agent Support**: tech-lead-advisor

## Next Steps
- Continuous refinement of the workflow
- Regular review and adjustment of the enhancement framework
