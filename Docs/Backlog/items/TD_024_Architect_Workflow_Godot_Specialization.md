# TD_024: Architect Workflow Godot/C# Specialization

## Overview
Enhance the architect workflow with specialized architecture decisions for Godot and C#:
- Add Godot-specific architecture decisions (scene vs code, memory management)
- Enhance C#/Godot boundary patterns
- Implement comprehensive VSA architecture rules
- Add architecture testing strategy
- Define migration and evolution patterns
