# VS_004: View Layer Debugging System with GDUnit4 Integration

**Type**: Vertical Slice  
**Priority**: üî• Critical  
**Size**: Medium  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Domain**: Debugging/Testing/UI

---

## üìã What & Why *(Product Owner)*

**User Story**: As a developer I want specialized view layer debugging tools so that I can systematically investigate UI/animation performance issues with proper data instead of assumptions.

**Value Proposition**: 
- Eliminates guesswork in view layer performance debugging
- Provides systematic approach to UI lag investigation  
- Integrates with GDUnit4 for automated performance regression testing
- Prevents future view layer performance issues through proactive monitoring

**Success Criteria**: Developers can quickly identify and resolve view layer performance bottlenecks using concrete data and measurements.

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Notes *(Tech Lead)*

**Architecture Pattern**: Follow `src/Features/Block/Move/` patterns for command/handler structure

**Key Components**:
- Commands: PerformanceProfileCommand, ViewLayerAnalysisCommand
- Handlers: Timing analysis, animation profiling, scene tree monitoring
- Presenters: Debug UI for real-time performance visualization
- Views: Godot-specific performance overlays and GDUnit4 test integration

**Integration Points**: 
- BlockVisualizationController instrumentation
- Animation timing measurement
- Scene tree operation profiling
- GDUnit4 test framework for automated performance testing
- Console output analysis and structured logging

**Risks/Concerns**: 
- Performance overhead from profiling tools
- GDUnit4 learning curve and integration complexity
- Balancing detailed debugging info with performance impact

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria *(Product Owner)*
- [ ] Given a view layer performance issue, When I enable debugging tools, Then I get concrete timing measurements
- [ ] Given animation lag concerns, When I run performance analysis, Then I see specific bottlenecks with millisecond precision
- [ ] Given performance regression risk, When I run GDUnit4 tests, Then view layer performance stays within acceptable bounds
- [ ] Given console output data, When I use analysis tools, Then I get structured insights about performance patterns
- [ ] Given debugging session, When I use view layer tools, Then I can identify root cause without making assumptions

## üß™ Testing Approach *(Test Designer + QA Engineer)*

**Unit Tests**: 
- [ ] Performance measurement accuracy
- [ ] Profiling overhead validation
- [ ] Analysis command correctness

**Integration Tests**:
- [ ] GDUnit4 integration for view layer performance
- [ ] End-to-end debugging workflow
- [ ] Performance regression detection

**GDUnit4 Specific Tests**:
- [ ] Animation timing validation (target: <16ms for 60fps)
- [ ] Scene tree operation performance bounds
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring during view operations

## üîÑ Dependencies
- **Depends on**: BF_001 investigation (need real performance data to validate tools)
- **Blocks**: Future view layer performance issues - this prevents debugging bottlenecks

---

## üìù Implementation Progress & Notes

**Current Status**: Need analysis - BF_001 falsely marked resolved without proper investigation

**Agent Updates**:
- 2025-08-17 - User: Previous debugger-expert made assumptions instead of investigating real data
- 2025-08-17 - Main Agent: Need specialized view layer debugging capability

**Blockers**: 
- Need user's console output for real data analysis
- GDUnit4 integration approach needs definition

**Next Steps**: 
1. Analyze user's console output for real performance patterns
2. Design specialized view layer debugging tools
3. Integrate with GDUnit4 for automated testing
4. Create systematic debugging workflow
