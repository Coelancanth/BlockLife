# TD_003: Block Movement Range Validation and Constraints

**Type**: Technical Debt  
**Priority**: 📈 Important  
**Category**: Architecture  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Impact**: Medium

---

## 🔧 The Problem
**What's Wrong**: Blocks can currently move unlimited distances across the grid, which may not align with game design intentions and lacks strategic movement constraints.

**Where**: `src/Features/Block/Commands/MoveBlockCommandHandler.cs` and `src/Core/Domain/Block/Block.cs`

**Why It Matters**: Game design likely needs movement constraints for strategic gameplay. Current unlimited movement may make gameplay too simple or break intended mechanics.

**Cost of Delay**: Game balance issues, potential need to redesign gameplay mechanics later if unlimited movement proves problematic.

---

## 💡 The Solution
**Approach**: Add MovementRange property to Block domain entity and enhance validation in MoveBlockCommandHandler

**Key Changes**:
- `src/Core/Domain/Block/Block.cs` - Add MovementRange property and CanMoveTo method
- `src/Features/Block/Commands/MoveBlockCommandHandler.cs` - Enhance ValidateMove with range checking
- `godot_project/features/block/placement/` - Visual feedback for valid movement range

**Benefits**: 
- Strategic gameplay depth through movement constraints
- Clear visual feedback for players about movement possibilities
- Configurable constraints per block type (future extensibility)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Migration
**Migration Strategy**: Incremental - add property with generous default, then tune based on gameplay

**Testing Requirements**:
- [ ] All existing movement tests continue to pass
- [ ] New tests for movement range validation
- [ ] Integration tests for visual range indicators

**Rollback Plan**: Set MovementRange to very high value (effectively unlimited) if gameplay issues arise

---

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Block entity has configurable MovementRange property
- [ ] MoveBlockCommandHandler validates movement distance
- [ ] Visual feedback shows valid movement area during interaction
- [ ] Default range allows reasonable movement (suggest 3-5 spaces)
- [ ] Range validation error messages are clear

## 🔄 Dependencies & Impact
**Depends On**: VS_001 (drag-and-drop provides ideal UX for range visualization)

**Blocks**: Nothing critical - pure enhancement

**Side Effects**: May affect game balance, requires playtesting to tune range values

## 📝 Progress & Notes

**Current Status**: Design complete in tech-lead plan, awaiting implementation

**Agent Updates**:
- 2025-08-17 - Tech Lead: Specified implementation approach in TD_002 technical plan (Phase 3)

**Blockers**: None - ready for implementation after VS_001
