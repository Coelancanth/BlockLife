# BF_002: Agent Triggers Not Firing Consistently

**Status**: Queued
**Severity**: High
**Priority**: P1
**Size**: S (2-3 hours)
**Sprint**: Next Session
**Found In**: 2025-08-15 / Automatic Orchestration Pattern Implementation
**Reported By**: Product Owner / User Experience

## Problem Description
The Automatic Orchestration Pattern implementation has inconsistent agent trigger behavior. Specifically, when users express feature requests (e.g., "I want to add"), the Product Owner agent doesn't activate reliably. This breaks the intended workflow where the PO should be automatically triggered after every agent action to maintain the Backlog as the Single Source of Truth.

**Impact**: Core workflow functionality partially broken - users may not receive proper product evaluation and prioritization when making feature requests.

## Reproduction Steps
1. User says "I want to add [feature]" or similar feature request language
2. Expected: Product Owner agent should automatically trigger for feature evaluation
3. Actual: PO agent triggers inconsistently - sometimes activates, sometimes doesn't
4. Result: Feature requests may bypass proper product evaluation process
5. Consequence: Backlog state becomes out of sync, breaking Single Source of Truth principle

## Root Cause Analysis
- Component affected: Agent trigger detection system in Automatic Orchestration Pattern
- Cause: Trigger point detection logic may have gaps in natural language pattern matching
- Why it wasn't caught: TD_012 implementation focused on architecture but may need refinement in trigger detection
- Related issue: TD_015 (PO Trigger Points Documentation) only 20% complete - may lack comprehensive trigger patterns

## Fix Approach

### Code Changes
- File: Agent trigger detection logic (location TBD based on TD_012 implementation)
  - Change: Enhance pattern matching for feature request language
  - Change: Add more comprehensive trigger phrases
  - Change: Implement fallback detection mechanisms
- File: Automatic Orchestration Pattern integration points
  - Change: Add logging to debug trigger detection failures
  - Change: Implement trigger validation and retry logic

### Affected Components
- Automatic Orchestration Pattern implementation (TD_012)
- Agent architecture integration (TD_014)
- Workflow trigger points (TD_015)

## Test Requirements

### Regression Test
```csharp
[Test]
public void Should_TriggerProductOwnerAgent_When_UserRequestsFeature()
{
    // Arrange
    var userInput = "I want to add multiplayer support";
    var triggerDetector = new AgentTriggerDetector();
    
    // Act
    var shouldTriggerPO = triggerDetector.ShouldTriggerProductOwner(userInput);
    
    // Assert
    shouldTriggerPO.Should().BeTrue("Feature request should always trigger PO evaluation");
}
```

### Additional Tests
- [ ] Unit test for various feature request phrasings
- [ ] Integration test for end-to-end trigger flow
- [ ] Test for edge cases and ambiguous language
- [ ] Property test for natural language pattern variations

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature request phrases consistently trigger PO agent
- [ ] No false negatives for obvious feature requests ("I want to add", "Can we implement", etc.)
- [ ] Trigger detection works for various natural language patterns
- [ ] Backlog state remains synchronized after PO trigger
- [ ] Logging provides visibility into trigger detection decisions

## Verification Steps
1. Test with multiple feature request phrasings
2. Verify PO agent activates for each attempt
3. Confirm Backlog gets updated appropriately
4. Check trigger detection logs for consistency
5. Test edge cases and boundary conditions

## Risk Assessment
- **Regression risk**: Low - This is additive improvement to existing pattern
- **Related areas**: All agent interactions, workflow synchronization
- **Testing needed**: Comprehensive natural language pattern testing

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Root cause identified in trigger detection logic
- [ ] Enhanced pattern matching implemented
- [ ] Regression tests added for various request patterns
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Trigger detection consistently works
- [ ] Verified with multiple feature request scenarios
- [ ] Logging provides debugging visibility
