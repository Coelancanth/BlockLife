# Bug Report: Duplicate Notification Publishing

**Template Used**: TEMPLATE_Bug_Report_And_Fix.md v1.1

---

## üìã Bug Information

### Basic Details
- **Bug ID**: BUG-003
- **Date Discovered**: 2025-08-14 (during investigation of BUG-002)
- **Discovered By**: Developer (through deep investigation)
- **Severity**: Medium (No user impact but inefficient processing)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed & Verified

### Description
**Symptom**: BlockPlacedNotification was being published twice for each block placement.

**Expected Behavior**: Notification should be published exactly once per block placement.

**Actual Behavior**: Notification was published twice - once by SimulationManager and once by PlaceBlockCommandHandler.

### Impact Assessment
- **User Impact**: None visible (view layer was already handling duplicates gracefully after BUG-002 fix)
- **System Impact**: Unnecessary processing overhead, potential for future bugs
- **Business Impact**: None immediate

### Bug Triage Matrix
| Criterion | Value | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **Severity** | Medium | Performance inefficiency |
| **Frequency** | Always | Every block placement |
| **Priority** | P1 | Fix in current sprint |
| **Users Affected** | 0% | No visible impact |

**Triage Decision**: Fix immediately to prevent future issues

## üîç Investigation

### Reproduction Steps
1. Place a block in the game
2. Observe logs showing "Published notification of type BlockPlacedNotification" twice
3. View layer receives duplicate notifications (handled gracefully after BUG-002)

### Environment
- **Platform**: Windows 10
- **Godot Version**: 4.4.1.stable.mono.official
- **Build**: Debug
- **Branch/Commit**: After BUG-002 fix

### Root Cause Analysis

#### **The "5 Whys" Technique**
1. **Why did BlockPlacedNotification publish twice?**
   ‚Üí Both SimulationManager and PlaceBlockCommandHandler were publishing it

2. **Why were both components publishing?**
   ‚Üí PlaceBlockCommandHandler was manually publishing after processing effects

3. **Why was handler publishing manually?**
   ‚Üí Code was redundantly publishing notification after SimulationManager already did

4. **Why was this redundancy not noticed?**
   ‚Üí No tests verified single publication constraint

5. **Why no tests for notification count? (ROOT CAUSE)**
   ‚Üí Lack of notification pipeline integrity tests

**Primary Cause**: Redundant notification publishing in PlaceBlockCommandHandler after SimulationManager already publishes via effect processing.

**Contributing Factors**: 
- Unclear responsibility boundaries for notification publishing
- Missing tests for notification pipeline integrity

**Why It Wasn't Caught**: 
- No unit tests verifying single notification constraint
- View layer was masking the issue by handling duplicates

### Code Investigation
**Affected Files**:
- `src/Features/Block/Placement/PlaceBlockCommandHandler.cs`: Redundant publishing code
- `src/Core/Application/Simulation/SimulationManager.cs`: Correct publishing location

**Key Code Snippet** (problematic):
```csharp
// ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC CODE - Double publishing
// In PlaceBlockCommandHandler:
var processResult = await ProcessQueuedEffects(); // This publishes notification
// ... then later ...
await _mediator.Publish(notification); // Publishing AGAIN!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix Implementation

### Solution Design
**Fix Strategy**: Remove redundant notification publishing from PlaceBlockCommandHandler. Let SimulationManager be the single source of notification publishing through effect processing.

**Alternatives Considered**: 
1. Remove publishing from SimulationManager (would break effect pattern)
2. Add deduplication layer (masks problem instead of fixing)
3. Keep both but add flag (unnecessary complexity)

**Why This Approach**: Single responsibility - SimulationManager owns effect processing and notification publishing.

### Implementation
**Fixed Code**:
```csharp
// ‚úÖ FIXED CODE - Single publishing point
// In PlaceBlockCommandHandler:
var processResult = await ProcessQueuedEffects(); // Only this publishes
// Removed manual _mediator.Publish() call
```

**Files Modified**:
- `src/Features/Block/Placement/PlaceBlockCommandHandler.cs`: Removed redundant publishing and IMediator dependency

### Testing Strategy
**Unit Tests Added**:
```csharp
[Fact]
public async Task PlaceBlockCommand_PublishesNotificationExactlyOnce()
{
    // Verify only one notification published
}

[Fact]
public async Task SimulationManager_ProcessBlockPlacedEffect_PublishesNotification()
{
    // Verify SimulationManager publishes correctly
}

[Fact]
public async Task PlaceBlockCommandHandler_DoesNotPublishDirectly()
{
    // Verify handler doesn't publish directly
}
```

**Test Files Created**:
- `tests/BlockLife.Core.Tests/Features/Block/Placement/NotificationDuplicationTests.cs`: 3 new tests

### Validation Results
- **All Tests Pass**: ‚úÖ 80 total tests passing (3 new notification tests added)
- **Manual Testing**: ‚úÖ No duplicate notifications in logs
- **Performance Impact**: Positive - reduced processing overhead
- **Breaking Changes**: None - internal implementation detail

## üìö Learning & Prevention

### Lessons Learned
1. **Technical**: Clear responsibility boundaries prevent duplication
2. **Process**: Test notification pipeline integrity, not just functionality
3. **Testing**: Verify constraints (e.g., "exactly once") not just success

### Architecture Implications  
**Should Architecture Change?**: Consider explicit notification publisher interface to clarify responsibilities.

**Similar Vulnerabilities**: Any command handler that processes effects might have similar issues.

**Prevention Strategies**: 
- Document that SimulationManager owns notification publishing
- Add architecture test ensuring handlers don't directly publish notifications
- Create notification count verification tests for all commands

### Process Improvements
**Code Review**: Check for duplicate publishing patterns

**Testing Gaps**: Need more pipeline integrity tests

**Monitoring**: Add metrics for notification counts per command

### Future Actions
- [ ] Add architecture test preventing direct notification publishing in handlers
- [ ] Review all command handlers for similar patterns
- [ ] Document notification publishing responsibility clearly
- [ ] Add notification metrics to identify duplicates

## üìä Impact Metrics

### Before Fix
- **Bug Frequency**: Every block placement (100%)
- **Time to Discover**: Found during BUG-002 investigation
- **Time to Fix**: 30 minutes (investigation + fix + tests)

### After Fix  
- **Test Coverage**: +3 notification pipeline tests
- **Performance**: ~50% reduction in notification processing overhead
- **Confidence Level**: High - clear single responsibility established

## üîó References

### Related Issues
- **Similar Bugs**: BUG-002 (View layer duplicate handling) - masked this issue
- **Architecture Decisions**: SimulationManager owns notification publishing
- **Documentation**: Updated to clarify notification pipeline

### External References
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should have one reason to change
- **Event Sourcing Patterns**: Single source of truth for events

## üéØ Key Takeaway

**This bug revealed an architectural ambiguity**: Who owns notification publishing? The fix establishes SimulationManager as the single source of truth for notification publishing through effect processing. Command handlers should only queue effects, not publish notifications directly.

**Report Completed**: 2025-08-14  
**Fix Status**: ‚úÖ Deployed and Verified  
**Follow-up Required**: Add architecture test to enforce notification publishing pattern
