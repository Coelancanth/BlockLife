### Root Cause Analysis

#### **The "5 Whys" Technique**
1. **Why did [symptom] occur?**
   ‚Üí [Answer that leads to next why]

2. **Why did [previous answer] happen?**
   ‚Üí [Answer that leads to next why]

3. **Why did [previous answer] happen?**
   ‚Üí [Answer that leads to next why]

4. **Why did [previous answer] happen?**
   ‚Üí [Answer that leads to next why]

5. **Why did [previous answer] happen? (ROOT CAUSE)**
   ‚Üí [The fundamental systemic issue]

**Primary Cause**: [Summarize the root cause from 5 Whys]

**Contributing Factors**: [Other conditions that enabled the bug]

**Why It Wasn't Caught**: [Analysis of why existing tests/reviews missed this]

### Code Investigation
**Affected Files**:
- `[FilePath]`: [Brief description of issue in this file]
- `[FilePath]`: [Brief description of issue in this file]

**Key Code Snippet** (problematic):
```csharp
// ‚ùå PROBLEMATIC CODE
public Guid BlockId => RequestedId ?? Guid.NewGuid(); // Generates new GUID each time!
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Fix Implementation

### Solution Design
**Fix Strategy**: [High-level approach to solving the problem]

**Alternatives Considered**: [Other solutions that were evaluated]

**Why This Approach**: [Reasoning for chosen solution]

### Implementation
**Fixed Code**:
```csharp
// ‚úÖ FIXED CODE  
private readonly Lazy<Guid> _blockId = new(() => Guid.NewGuid());
public Guid BlockId => RequestedId ?? _blockId.Value; // Stable GUID generation
```

**Files Modified**:
- `[FilePath]`: [Description of changes made]
- `[FilePath]`: [Description of changes made]

### Testing Strategy
**Regression Tests Added**:
```csharp
/// <summary>
/// REGRESSION TEST: [Brief description of what this prevents]
/// 
/// BUG CONTEXT:
/// - Date: [Date]  
/// - Issue: [Brief issue description]
/// - Symptom: [What users saw]
/// - Root Cause: [Technical cause]
/// - Fix: [How it was fixed]
/// 
/// This test prevents regression by verifying:
/// 1. [Specific behavior 1]
/// 2. [Specific behavior 2]
/// 3. [Specific behavior 3]
/// </summary>
[Fact]
public void [TestName]_[Scenario]_[ExpectedBehavior]()
{
    // Arrange
    // Act  
    // Assert - Ensure the bug cannot reoccur
}
```

**Test Files Modified**:
- `[TestFilePath]`: [Tests added/modified]

### Validation Results
- **All Tests Pass**: [‚úÖ/‚ùå] 
- **Manual Testing**: [‚úÖ/‚ùå] - [Description of manual verification]
- **Performance Impact**: [None/Minimal/Measured improvement]
- **Breaking Changes**: [None/List any breaking changes]

## üìö Learning & Prevention

### Lessons Learned
1. **Technical**: [What we learned about the codebase/architecture]
2. **Process**: [What we learned about our development process]  
3. **Testing**: [What gaps this revealed in our testing strategy]

### Architecture Implications  
**Should Architecture Change?**: [Yes/No - reasoning]

**Similar Vulnerabilities**: [Are there other places with similar risks?]

**Prevention Strategies**: [How can we prevent this class of bugs?]

### Process Improvements
