# Incident Report: F1 Block Placement Implementation Issues

**Incident ID**: IR_20250813_001  
**Date**: 2025-08-13  
**Type**: Implementation  
**Severity**: High (Build Breaking)  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Feature**: F1 Block Placement Vertical Slice  

## Executive Summary

Multiple critical issues encountered during F1 implementation that broke compilation and tests, requiring systematic fixes to restore functionality. Primary issues included type ambiguity, DI registration problems, error message inconsistency, and missing validation.

## Timeline

- **08:00** - F1 implementation begins
- **10:00** - Initial implementation complete (2 hours)
- **10:15** - Compilation errors discovered
- **13:15** - All issues resolved (3 hours debugging)
- **Total Impact**: 5 hours

## Issues Resolved

### 1. LanguageExt.Fin<T> Type Ambiguity ✅

**Symptom**: Compiler error - ambiguous reference between custom `Fin<A>` wrapper and `LanguageExt.Fin<A>`

**Root Cause**: Attempted to create custom wrapper class around LanguageExt.Fin<T> to add marker interface

**Architecture Principle Violated**: 
- Don't wrap third-party types unnecessarily
- Favor composition over inheritance for external libraries

**Resolution**:
- Removed custom Fin<A> wrapper class
- Used LanguageExt.Fin<T> directly in all interfaces
- Updated ICommand interfaces to use fully qualified type names

### 2. Presenter DI Registration Issues ✅

**Symptom**: DI container validation failure - GridPresenter requires IGridView which isn't registered

**Root Cause**: 
- Presenters were being auto-registered by MediatR as INotificationHandler
- Presenters were also manually registered in DI container
- Presenters require view dependencies that only exist at runtime

**Architecture Principle Violated**:
- Presenters should be created via factory pattern with runtime dependencies
- Don't register types that have unresolvable dependencies

**Resolution**:
- Removed INotificationHandler implementation from GridPresenter
- Removed manual presenter registration from GameStrapper
- Presenters now only created via PresenterFactory

### 3. Error Message Format Inconsistency ✅

**Symptom**: Test failures due to error message format mismatches

**Root Cause**: 
- Error.New() used with both single parameter (message) and dual parameter (code, message) formats
- Tests expected specific formats that didn't match implementation

**Resolution**:
- Standardized all Error.New() calls to single-parameter format
- Updated all test assertions to match actual error messages

### 4. Missing Validation in RemoveBlockCommandHandler ✅

**Symptom**: Test failure - "cannot remove last block" rule not being enforced

**Root Cause**: Handler was bypassing RemovalValidationRule and going directly to GridStateService

**Architecture Principle Violated**:
- All business rules must be enforced through validation rules
- Handlers should always validate before executing operations

**Resolution**:
- Added validation rule check before removal operation
- Ensured all validation failures return appropriate errors

## Impact Analysis

### Technical Impact
- **Build System**: 3 hours of build instability
- **Test Suite**: Multiple test failures requiring fixes
- **Development Velocity**: 60% time overhead for debugging vs. initial implementation

### Business Impact
- **Feature Delivery**: F1 implementation delayed by 3 hours
- **Quality**: No regression to existing functionality
- **Risk**: Issues caught in development phase, not production

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons
1. **Type System Clarity**: Don't create wrapper types that conflict with library types
2. **DI Boundaries**: Not everything needs to be in the DI container - use factories for runtime dependencies
3. **Error Consistency**: Establish and document error handling patterns early
4. **Validation First**: Always validate before executing state changes
5. **Test-Implementation Alignment**: Keep test assertions synchronized with actual implementation

### Process Lessons
1. **Incremental Testing**: Test after each major architectural decision
2. **Architecture Validation**: Run architecture fitness tests during implementation
3. **Error Pattern Documentation**: Need clearer error handling guidelines

## Prevention Measures Implemented ✅

### Architecture Tests Added
- Added `CommandHandlers_ShouldNotContain_TryCatchBlocks()` test
- Added `TaskFinExtensions_ShouldBe_Available()` test  
- Existing tests already prevent Godot imports and DI violations

### Future Enhancements Identified
- Document error handling patterns in architecture guide
- Add validation pipeline behavior for automatic validation
