## VSA Refactoring Decision Matrix

### Extract to Infrastructure When:
- ✅ Database/repository logic duplicated across slices
- ✅ External service integrations repeated
- ✅ Cross-cutting utilities (logging, validation)
- ✅ Framework abstractions

### Extract to Domain When:
- ✅ Value objects (GridPosition, BlockId) duplicated
- ✅ Domain errors and exceptions
- ✅ Mathematical utilities and business constants
- ✅ Validation rules that are truly domain-wide

### Keep in Slices When:
- ❌ Feature-specific business logic
- ❌ Feature-specific DTOs and commands
- ❌ UI components and view logic
- ❌ Feature-specific validation rules
- ❌ Slice-specific tests

## Duplication Assessment Checklist

Before extracting code:
- [ ] Is this identical in 3+ slices?
- [ ] Is this infrastructure/technical concern?
- [ ] Will this likely remain identical?
- [ ] Does extraction preserve slice independence?
- [ ] What's the coupling cost vs. duplication cost?

## Common Extraction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Service Extraction
```csharp
// From: Multiple handlers with same logic
// To: Shared service with interface
```

### Pattern 2: Value Object Consolidation
```csharp
// From: Similar records in each slice
// To: Single domain value object
```

### Pattern 3: Base Class Creation
```csharp
// From: Repeated handler patterns
// To: Abstract base class
```

## Validation After Extraction

Post-refactoring checklist:
- [ ] Dependencies flow inward only (Slices → Infrastructure → Domain)
- [ ] No slice-to-slice dependencies created
- [ ] Each slice remains independently testable
- [ ] All architecture tests still pass
- [ ] No business logic leaked to infrastructure

## Integration Points
- **Architect**: Validate architectural compliance of extractions
- **QA Engineer**: Ensure testing strategy supports refactored structure
- **Dev Engineer**: Implementation of extracted components
