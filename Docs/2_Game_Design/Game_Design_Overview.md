### **Latent Trait System** *(PLANNED)*
- We can call it the "Latent Trait" system. At the start of a new life, the game generates a hidden set of affinities for the character, influenced by their parents or a choice the player makes. For a first playthrough, it could be a random selection. For subsequent "generations," the achievements of the previous life directly shape the pool for their child. Player is aware of the existence of latent trait, but don't know what it is unless it's already have been in the codex.
