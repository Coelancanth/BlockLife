# Core Mechanic: Block Narratives

This document details the design for various special blocks that serve as narrative devices, creating emergent stories and dilemmas for the player.

---

## 1. Relationship Blocks

-   **Concept**: Representing the complexity of human connection.
-   **Blocks**:
    -   **"Rival" Block**: Appears during academic or career stages. Cannot be moved or merged. Periodically challenges the player's corresponding "Skill" or "Career" block, creating a sense of competition and pressure.
    -   **"Bond" Link**: A visual link that forms between adjacent, compatible relationship blocks ("Friendship," "Love"). Bonded blocks share benefits (e.g., "Friendship" can absorb "Stress" from "Career") but also share harm (if one block degrades, the other is negatively affected).
    -   **"Pet" Block**: A low-level block that provides no strategic resources but has the unique ability to automatically absorb and neutralize small negative emotional blocks (like "Loneliness" or "Annoyance") each turn.

## 2. Health & Psychology Blocks

-   **Concept**: Modeling the internal state and mental health of the character.
-   **Blocks**:
    -   **"Burnout" Block**: Results from over-merging "Work" blocks while "Mindset" is low. Locks adjacent tiles and drains "Energy" until cleansed with "Vacation" or "Hobby" blocks.
    -   **"Inner Demon" Block**: Can spawn after a major failure ("Fired," "Divorce"). Periodically duplicates another negative block on the board. Cannot be removed directly; fades away only when "Mindset" is kept at a very high level for a sustained period.
    -   **"Comfort Zone" Block**: If a player only merges one type of block for a very long time, the highest-level block may transform into this. It's very stable but drastically reduces the variety of new blocks spawning nearby, representing stagnation.

## 3. Growth & Legacy Blocks

-   **Concept**: Representing personal growth, dreams, and the legacy left behind.
-   **Blocks**:
    -   **"Forgotten Dream" Block**: A "Hobby" block from youth that was neglected. It becomes a permanent, unmovable grey block on the grid. It does nothing, serving only as a silent, constant reminder of a path not taken. Can be reactivated in mid-life at enormous cost.
    -   **"Eureka!" Moment**: A rare outcome of a very high-level or complex merge. Triggers a temporary state where all merges of a specific type are free and yield extra rewards, simulating a breakthrough.
    -   **"Legacy" Project**: In the elder years, players can start a "Legacy" project (e.g., "Write a Book," "Mentor a Successor"). This is a multi-stage block that requires a huge investment of "Wisdom" and "Experience" blocks to complete, but contributes massively to the final "Life Score."
