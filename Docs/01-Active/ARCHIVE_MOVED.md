# Archive Moved - Important Notice

**⚠️ ATTENTION: Archive.md has been moved and consolidated!**

## What Happened (2025-08-21)
The archive file previously located here (`Docs/01-Active/Archive.md`) has been **safely merged** into the canonical archive location to resolve data integrity issues.

## New Location
**All archive content is now at**: [`Docs/07-Archive/Completed_Backlog.md`](../07-Archive/Completed_Backlog.md)

## Why This Change?
- **Data Integrity**: Two separate archive files (Archive.md and Completed_Backlog.md) created confusion and data loss risk
- **Single Source of Truth**: All completed/rejected items now in one authoritative location
- **Proper Organization**: Archives belong in the 07-Archive folder, not 01-Active

## All Data Preserved
✅ **488 lines** from Archive.md were safely merged  
✅ **Critical safeguards** preserved (append-only rules, recovery protocols)  
✅ **All references updated** (backlog-assistant, Strategic Prioritizer)  
✅ **Git history maintained** for full audit trail

## Action Required
**Update any personal bookmarks or references to point to:**
```
Docs/07-Archive/Completed_Backlog.md
```
