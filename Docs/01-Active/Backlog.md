## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### BR_015: Fix Failing PurchaseMergeUnlockCommandHandler Tests
**Status**: ~~Proposed~~ **Resolved** 2025-08-26 23:41
**Owner**: Debugger Expert
**Size**: S (2-3h actual: 40 min)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25
**Markers**: [TEST-FAILURE] [BLOCKING-PR]

**What**: 3 tests failing in PurchaseMergeUnlockCommandHandler due to incorrect test setup
**Why**: Tests block PR merge and may indicate logic issues in merge unlock implementation

**Root Cause Found**:
1. PlayerState.CreateNew() defaulted MaxUnlockedTier = 2 (for testing)
2. This broke purchase validation - player already had T2 unlocked
3. Test helper also needed proper UpdatePlayer() call with version tracking

**Fix Applied**:
- Changed default MaxUnlockedTier from 2 to 1 in PlayerState
- Fixed SetupTestPlayerWithMoneyAndUnlockedTier helper to use UpdatePlayer()
- Enabled 2 previously skipped tests that now work

**Result**: All 9 PurchaseMergeUnlockCommandHandler tests now pass

## üìà Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### VS_005: User-Facing Merge Unlock UI
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:43

**What**: Create accessible UI for players to purchase merge pattern unlocks without debug keys
**Why**: Players currently can only unlock merge abilities via F8 debug panel - needs proper in-game UI

**Current State**:
- Backend purchase system fully working (VS_003B-3)
- F8 debug panel has functional unlock UI but is developer-only
- Players start with T1 (match-only), need to buy T2+ for merge patterns

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add unlock button/shop to main game UI (not debug panel)
- Show current tier and available upgrades
- Display costs clearly (T2: 100, T3: 500, T4: 2500)
- Visual feedback when unlock succeeds
- Integrate with existing PurchaseMergeUnlockCommand

**Done When**:
- Players can see and purchase merge unlocks in normal gameplay
- No debug keys required for unlock progression
- Clear cost/benefit shown before purchase
- Visual confirmation of successful unlock

### TD_084: Refactor to Use LanguageExt Collections Instead of System.Collections.Generic
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Tech Lead
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [FUNCTIONAL-PARADIGM]

**What**: Replace System.Collections.Generic with LanguageExt immutable collections
**Why**: Violates functional programming paradigm, causes potential mutation bugs

**Current Violations** (10+ files):
- MergePatternExecutor uses List<Block> (mutable)
- MatchPatternRecognizer uses HashSet<Vector2Int> (mutable)
- PlayerState uses Dictionary<ResourceType, int> (should use Map)

**Proposed Solution**:
- Replace List<T> with Lst<T> or Seq<T>
- Replace HashSet<T> with Set<T>
- Replace Dictionary<K,V> with Map<K,V>
- Update all LINQ operations to LanguageExt equivalents

**Pattern Match**: Follow existing patterns in IGridStateService which correctly uses Map

**Done When**:
- No System.Collections.Generic imports in Core domain
- All collections are immutable
- Tests still pass

### BR_016: MergePatternExecutor Missing Error Handling for Edge Cases
**Status**: ~~Proposed~~ **Resolved** 2025-08-26 23:50
**Owner**: Debugger Expert  
**Size**: S (2-3h actual: 25 min)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25

**What**: MergePatternExecutor lacks defensive programming for several edge cases
**Why**: Could cause runtime exceptions in production

**Defensive Programming Added**:
1. ‚úÖ Null checks for context and context.GridService
2. ‚úÖ Empty collection validation before First()
3. ‚úÖ Created defensive copy of positions to avoid concurrent modification
4. ‚úÖ Tier bounds validation (max T4) with proper error messages
5. ‚úÖ Null pattern checks in CanExecute and EstimateExecutionTime

**Tests Added**: 8 new defensive programming tests covering all edge cases
**Result**: MergePatternExecutor now gracefully handles all edge cases with Fin<T> errors

**Done When**:
- All edge cases return proper Error results
- No possibility of NullReferenceException
- Unit tests cover edge cases

### TD_085: Add Comprehensive Logging and Telemetry to Pattern System
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25

**What**: Pattern recognition and execution lacks sufficient observability
**Why**: Cannot debug production issues or understand performance bottlenecks

**Missing Telemetry**:
- Pattern recognition timing metrics
- Match vs Merge execution counts
- Tier progression statistics
- Failed pattern execution reasons
- Performance counters for grid operations

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- Implement performance counters
- Track pattern success/failure rates
- Add debug visualizations for pattern detection

**Pattern Match**: Follow logging patterns in ProcessPatternsAfterPlacementHandler

**Done When**:
- Every pattern operation is logged
- Performance metrics available
- Can trace full pattern lifecycle


## üí° Ideas (Do Later)
*Nice-to-have features, experimental concepts, future considerations*

### TD_086: Implement Property-Based Testing for Pattern Recognition
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: L (8-12h)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25

**What**: Add FsCheck property tests for pattern recognition invariants
**Why**: Ensure pattern detection is mathematically correct under all conditions

**Properties to Test**:
- Pattern recognition is deterministic (same grid = same patterns)
- No overlapping patterns (each position in max 1 pattern)
- Merge patterns preserve block count invariants
- Pattern execution is idempotent when repeated

**Pattern Match**: Follow FsCheck 3.x patterns in existing property tests

### TD_087: Performance Optimization for Large Grid Pattern Recognition
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: L (8-12h)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25

**What**: Optimize pattern recognition for 100x100+ grids
**Why**: Current O(n¬≤) algorithm may lag with large grids

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Implement spatial indexing for pattern detection
- Cache adjacent block lookups
- Use parallel pattern recognition for independent regions
- Implement dirty region tracking to avoid full scans

**Done When**:
- Pattern recognition <16ms for 100x100 grid
- Profiling shows no hot spots
- Memory usage remains flat

### TD_088: Add Visual Pattern Recognition Debugging Tools
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: M (6-8h)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:25

**What**: Create debug overlay showing pattern detection in real-time
**Why**: Developers cannot easily see why patterns aren't triggering

**Features**:
- Overlay showing detected patterns with different colors
- Pattern type labels (Match vs Merge)
- Execution order visualization
- Frame-by-frame pattern state replay
- Export pattern detection logs

**Done When**:
- F10 key toggles pattern debug overlay
- Can step through pattern execution
- Clear visual indication of pattern boundaries

### TD_081: Add Comprehensive Merge System Test Coverage
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 20:20
**Complexity Score**: 3/10 (straightforward testing work)

**What**: Add missing test coverage for merge pattern execution system
**Why**: Core game mechanic has only 5 basic tests, missing critical path validation

**Current State**:
- MergePatternExecutorBasicTests: 5 tests (config and error cases only)
- Missing: Actual merge execution tests
- Missing: Tier scaling validation
- Missing: Integration tests

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add 20+ tests to MergePatternExecutorTests
- Test 3 T1 ‚Üí 1 T2 transformation
- Test tier scaling (3x, 9x, 27x multipliers)
- Test mixed tier validation (should fail)
- Integration tests for full merge flow
- Property-based tests for invariants

**Simpler Alternative**: Just add 5-10 happy path tests (Score: 1/10)
- Would cover basic functionality but miss edge cases

**Pattern Match**: Follow existing test patterns in MatchPatternExecutorTests

### TD_082: Fix Pre-Existing Test Compilation Errors (BlockPlacedEffect Constructor)
**Status**: ~~Proposed~~ **Completed 2025-08-26 23:21**
**Owner**: ~~Test Specialist~~
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:00
**Complexity Score**: 4/10 (systematic test fixing)

**What**: Fix compilation errors preventing test suite execution
**Why**: PR can't merge with failing tests - CI/CD requires clean build

**Current Issue**:
- 14 test files failing with `CS7036: There is no argument given that corresponds to the required parameter 'PlacedAt'`
- BlockPlacedEffect constructor signature changed but tests not updated
- Affects SimulationManagerThreadSafetyTests, SimulationManagerRegressionTests, etc.

**Proposed Solution**:
- Add missing `PlacedAt` parameter to all BlockPlacedEffect constructor calls
- Verify parameter order matches current constructor signature  
- Run test suite to ensure no remaining compilation errors
- Add proper DateTime values for PlacedAt parameter

**Pattern Match**: Follow existing test patterns for effect creation

**Simpler Alternative**: Fix just the failing tests (Score: 2/10)
- Would get tests compiling but might miss parameter usage patterns

### TD_083: Polish Merge System for Production Readiness  
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (3-4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-26 23:00
**Complexity Score**: 3/10 (refinement work)

**What**: Polish and refine merge system implementation for production quality
**Why**: Current implementation works but needs final polish before release

**Polish Areas**:
- Performance optimization for pattern recognition with tier checking
- Error message improvements for invalid merge scenarios
- Edge case handling (empty patterns, invalid positions)
- Code documentation for maintenance
- Consider adding merge animation timing controls

**Proposed Solution**:
- Review pattern recognition performance impact of tier checking
- Enhance error messages with more context
- Add comprehensive parameter validation
- Clean up any remaining TODO/FIXME comments
- Performance testing with large grids

**Pattern Match**: Follow existing performance optimization patterns

**Simpler Alternative**: Just add documentation (Score: 1/10)
- Would improve maintainability but miss performance opportunities
