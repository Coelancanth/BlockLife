## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### BR_012: Git Worktree Branch Conflict Prevents Persona System Usage
**Status**: New
**Owner**: Debugger Expert
**Size**: M (4-8h)
**Priority**: Critical
**Markers**: [WORKFLOW] [GIT] [PERSONA-SYSTEM]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Git worktrees prevent same branch from being checked out in multiple workspaces
**Why**: Blocks proper persona system usage - can't work on feature branches in persona workspaces
**How**: 
- Research git worktree branch sharing limitations
- Design workflow for feature work in persona environments
- Consider solutions: workspace-specific branches, branch forwarding, or workflow changes
- Test solution with actual persona system usage
**Done When**: 
- DevOps Engineer can work on feat/persona-system-v2 from DevOps workspace
- Clear workflow documented for feature work in persona environments
- No compromise to persona isolation benefits
- Solution works consistently across all personas
**Depends On**: None

**Problem Context**: While implementing Persona System v2.0, discovered that git worktrees prevent checking out the same branch (feat/persona-system-v2) in both main directory and persona workspace. This forces choice between persona isolation and proper feature branch workflow.

**Impact**: Major workflow friction that defeats the purpose of persona system. Currently requires awkward workarounds like working in main directory (loses isolation) or creating separate branches per workspace (complicates merging).

**Workaround**: Created feat/devops-persona-v2 branch for now, but this doesn't scale.


## üìà Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### TD_029: Add Main Directory Protection for Persona Worktree System
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [PRODUCTIVITY] [SAFETY]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Create warning system to prevent accidental work in main directory when personas should be used
**Why**: Users may accidentally open Claude in main directory, losing isolation benefits and risking conflicts
**How**: 
- Create claude.ps1 wrapper script with warning
- Add .claude-warning marker file
- Update README with clear guidance
- Optional git hook for commit warnings
**Done When**: 
- Warning appears when opening Claude in main
- Clear redirection to blocklife command
- Documentation updated
- Accidental main work reduced to near-zero
**Depends On**: TD_023 (Complete)

**Problem Context**: With worktree system complete, nothing prevents accidentally working in main directory which loses isolation benefits and can create conflicts
**Proposed Solution**: Gentle guardrails that remind users to use workspaces without being obstructive

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-20):
- **Complexity Score**: 2/10
- **Decision**: Approved as simple, non-intrusive safety guardrail
- **Rationale**: PowerShell wrapper pattern matches existing tooling, allows bypass for legitimate work, minimal implementation risk
- **Technical Guidance**: Use .claude-warning marker approach that can be checked by wrapper script for clean detection

### TD_030: Simplify Persona Backlog Update Suggestions
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [UX] [PRODUCTIVITY]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Personas should provide concise task summaries instead of detailed backlog-assistant commands
**Why**: Current pattern shows full command syntax which is verbose and intimidating for users, reduces readability
**How**: 
- Update all persona documentation to suggest summaries in bullet points
- User can request command generation if needed
- Focus on WHAT changed not HOW to update
**Done When**: 
- All personas provide clean summaries like "Mark VS_004 complete, Create TD_031 for refactoring"
- Commands only generated on explicit request
- Documentation updated
**Depends On**: None

**Problem**: Personas currently suggest long, detailed backlog-assistant commands that are hard to read and review
**Better Approach**: Simple bullet summaries that user can easily understand and approve

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-20):
- **Complexity Score**: 1/10
- **Decision**: Approved as pure documentation improvement
- **Rationale**: Reduces cognitive load, improves readability, no technical changes required, aligns with simplicity principle
- **Implementation Note**: Update all persona docs to use bullet summaries instead of showing full backlog-assistant command syntax

### TD_031: Add Verification Step for Subagent Work Completion
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [PROCESS] [QUALITY]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Create verification mechanism to confirm subagent tasks are actually completed
**Why**: Currently operating on trust without verification - subagents report completion but we don't verify
**How**: 
- Add post-subagent verification step in workflows
- Create simple verification scripts/patterns
- Document verification protocol for each subagent type
- Consider adding automated checks where possible
**Done When**: 
- Verification patterns documented for all subagents
- Scripts/tools created for common verifications
- Process integrated into persona workflows
- False completion reports detectible
**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-20):
- Complexity Score: 3/10
- Decision: Auto-approved as process improvement
- Rationale: Addresses real trust-but-don't-verify gap in our automation
- Owner: DevOps (workflow tooling and process automation)


## üí° Ideas (Do Later)
*Nice-to-have features, experimental concepts, future considerations*

### TD_033: Create PowerShell Custom Tool Prototype for Architecture Validation
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Tech Lead
**Size**: L (1-3 days)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [TOOLING] [PROTOTYPE]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Create custom PowerShell tool for Claude Code to validate architecture and patterns
**Why**: Current validation requires multiple grep/read operations; structured validation would catch issues early
**How**: 
- Implement after TD_029/030 to compare approaches
- Create validate-architecture.ps1 with structured output
- Check Clean Architecture boundaries
- Validate Glossary term usage in code
- Compare against Move Block reference pattern
- Return JSON with violations and suggestions
**Done When**: 
- Tool validates architecture rules programmatically
- Returns structured data Claude can interpret
- Demonstrates clear value over manual checking
- Decision made on wider custom tool adoption
**Depends On**: TD_029, TD_030 (learn from implementation)

**Problem Context**: We manually check architecture compliance through multiple file reads and greps. A custom tool could provide instant, structured feedback.
**Prototype Goal**: Evaluate if custom PowerShell tools reduce cognitive load and improve quality
**Success Metrics**: Time saved, bugs prevented, developer experience improvement

### TD_034: Enforce Up-to-Date Branch Requirement via Sacred Sequence Automation
**Status**: Done
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (<4h)
**Priority**: Important
**Markers**: [GIT] [PROCESS] [AUTOMATION]
**Created**: 2025-08-20
**Completed**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Implement Sacred Sequence enforcement through smart git aliases and pre-push hooks
**Why**: PR #49 conflict was caused by not fetching/pulling main first - AI agents forget the ritual
**How**: 
- ‚úÖ Created smart git aliases (git newbranch, syncmain, sacred, checkfresh)
- ‚úÖ Implemented pre-push hook that blocks stale branches
- ‚úÖ Created installation script for easy deployment
- ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with mandatory AI agent commands
- ‚úÖ Updated GitWorkflow.md with Sacred Sequence enforcement documentation
**Done When**: 
- ‚úÖ Smart aliases prevent creating stale branches
- ‚úÖ Pre-push hook blocks outdated branches from being pushed
- ‚úÖ GitWorkflow.md and CLAUDE.md updated with new workflow
- ‚úÖ AI agents can't accidentally create conflicts from stale branches
**Depends On**: None

**Problem Context**: PR #49 had conflicts because branch was created without fetching latest main. While GitWorkflow.md documents the Sacred Sequence, AI agents sometimes forget to follow it.
**Solution Implemented**: Three-layer enforcement system - smart aliases (prevention), pre-push hooks (detection), and clear documentation (education). The `git newbranch` command automatically enforces the Sacred Sequence, making it impossible to create stale branches.
**Implementation Notes**: Git aliases have some shell compatibility issues between Git Bash and PowerShell, but the critical pre-push hook works perfectly. This provides the essential safety net for preventing PR conflicts.

### TD_032: Fix Persona Documentation Routing and Ownership Gaps
**Status**: Approved
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: M (4-8h)
**Priority**: Ideas
**Markers**: [DOCUMENTATION] [PRODUCTIVITY]
**Created**: 2025-08-20

**What**: Add routing tables and "what NOT to accept" sections to all persona documents
**Why**: Current docs cause work misrouting - personas don't know when to hand off to others
**How**: 
- Add "Work I Don't Accept" section to each persona doc
- Create master routing table in QuickReference.md
- Expand DevOps ownership to include all dev tooling/scripts
- Clarify Test Specialist vs Debugger Expert handoff criteria
- Add cross-references between related personas
**Done When**: 
- Each persona has clear rejection criteria
- Master routing table exists and is referenced
- No ambiguity about who owns what type of work
- DevOps owns all developer experience improvements
**Depends On**: None

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-20):
- Complexity Score: 4/10
- Decision: Auto-approved as documentation improvement
- Rationale: Addresses systematic routing confusion discovered during TD_029/030 review
- Impact: Prevents future work misrouting and clarifies ownership
- Pattern: Similar to tech-lead.md improvements just completed
