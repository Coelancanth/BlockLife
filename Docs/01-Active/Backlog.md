# BlockLife Development Backlog

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-23 21:26
**Last Aging Check**: 2025-08-22
> üìö See BACKLOG_AGING_PROTOCOL.md for 3-10 day aging rules

## üî¢ Next Item Numbers by Type
**CRITICAL**: Before creating new items, check and update the appropriate counter.

- **Next BR**: 014 (Last: BR_013 - 2025-08-22)
- **Next TD**: 079 (Last: TD_078 - 2025-08-24)  
- **Next VS**: 004 (Last: VS_003D - 2025-08-19)

**Protocol**: Check your type's counter ‚Üí Use that number ‚Üí Increment the counter ‚Üí Update timestamp

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona


### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items
```markdown
### [Type]_[Number]: Short Name
**Status**: Proposed | Approved | In Progress | Done
**Owner**: [Persona Name]  ‚Üê Single responsible persona
**Size**: S (<4h) | M (4-8h) | L (1-3 days) | XL (>3 days)
**Priority**: Critical | Important | Ideas
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [SAFETY-CRITICAL] etc. (if applicable)

**What**: One-line description
**Why**: Value in one sentence  
**How**: 3-5 technical approach bullets (if known)
**Done When**: 3-5 acceptance criteria
**Depends On**: Item numbers or None

**[Owner] Decision** (date):  ‚Üê Added after ultra-think
- Decision rationale
- Risks considered
- Next steps
```

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

*None*

## üìà Important (Do Next)
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### TD_070: DI Registration Validator (Test-Based)
**Status**: Approved with Modification ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: S (1h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-22

**What**: Test-based validation for critical service registrations
**Why**: Missing DI registrations cause cascade test failures that mask root cause
**How**:
- Create GameStrapperValidationTests.cs that runs first
- Verify all critical interfaces have implementations registered
- Check MediatR handler discovery works
- Run as first test in Architecture category (per TD_071)
**Done When**:
- Test fails fast if critical services not registered
- Clear error messages identify missing registrations
- No more "13 tests fail from 1 missing service"

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-23):
- ‚ö†Ô∏è APPROVED WITH MODIFICATION - Reduced complexity from 5/10 to 2/10
- Use GameStrapperValidationTests instead of source generator
- Simpler to implement and debug (just a test)
- Runs in Architecture test category for fast feedback
- Can evolve to source generator later if needed

### TD_071: Test Categories for Faster Feedback
**Status**: Done ‚úÖ
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (2h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-22
**Completed**: 2025-08-24

**What**: Categorize tests for staged execution (Architecture/Integration/Stress)
**Why**: Get faster feedback on architectural issues before running slow tests
**How**:
- Add [Trait("Category", "Architecture")] to fast validation tests
- Configure pre-commit hook to run only Architecture category
- CI pipeline runs categories in stages
**Done When**:
- Architecture tests complete in <5 seconds
- Pre-commit catches namespace/DI issues immediately
- CI fails fast on architectural violations

### TD_078: Timestamp Accuracy Protocol for Memory Bank & Session Logs
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: S (1-2h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-24 01:59

**What**: Enforce getting current date/time before updating timestamped documents
**Why**: Inaccurate timestamps in Memory Bank and session logs cause confusion
**How**:
- Update embody.ps1 to capture timestamp at start of execution
- Add validation to ensure timestamps are current (not stale)
- Update CLAUDE.md to remind about running `date` command first
- Consider auto-timestamp injection for session log entries
**Done When**:
- Memory Bank updates always have accurate timestamps
- Session log entries reflect actual work time
- No more "future dated" or incorrect timestamps
- Process is automatic/zero-friction

**DevOps Engineer Notes**:
- Common issue: Updating Memory Bank with old timestamps
- Solution: Capture `Get-Date` at script start, use throughout
- Could add timestamp validation (reject if >5 min old)
- Make it impossible to get wrong, not just documented

### TD_077: Incremental Test Runner for 95% Faster Feedback
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: M (4-6h)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-24

**What**: Git-based incremental test runner for local AND CI/CD environments
**Why**: Current tests take 39s locally, CI runs all tests on every PR (wasteful)
**How**:
- Detect changed files via git diff (local) or GitHub API (CI)
- Map source files to test files using conventions
- Run only affected test classes/categories
- Cache test results by file hash (with GitHub Actions cache)
- Progressive execution: unit ‚Üí integration ‚Üí architecture
- CI: Use GitHub's changed-files action for PR-specific testing
**Done When**:
- Local: Single-file changes test in <2 seconds
- CI: PR with focused changes runs in <30s (vs 2-3 min)
- GitHub Actions workflow uses incremental strategy
- Full suite still runs on main branch merges
- Clear reporting in PR comments showing what was tested

**DevOps Engineer Notes**:
- Convention mapping: MoveBlockCommand.cs ‚Üí MoveBlockCommandHandlerTests.cs
- Scope detection: Architecture file ‚Üí Architecture category only
- Could integrate with file watcher for real-time testing
- Massive productivity boost: 39s ‚Üí 2s = 37 seconds saved per test run

**CI/CD Implementation Details**:
- Add new `incremental-tests` job that runs before `build-and-test`
- Use `dorny/paths-filter@v2` to detect changed files in PRs
- Map file changes to test categories/namespaces
- Cache test results with `actions/cache@v3` keyed by file hashes
- PR workflow: incremental (30s) ‚Üí fail fast or skip full suite
- Main branch: always run full suite for baseline
- Expected savings: 90% CI time reduction for typical single-file PRs

## üìã Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** ‚Üí üî• Critical
2. **Current milestone?** ‚Üí üìà Important  
3. **Everything else** ‚Üí üí° Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes ‚Üí Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with üî• priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
