# BlockLife Development Backlog

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-19

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Ultra-Think Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
2. **Ultra-Think** if `Status: Proposed` and you're the owner (5-15 min deep analysis)
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona

#### Ultra-Think Triggers:
- **Automatic**: When you own a "Proposed" item
- **Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE], [ROOT-CAUSE], [SAFETY-CRITICAL], [COMPLEX]
- **Output**: Document decision rationale directly in the item

### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

### Adding New Items

### VS_003: Triple-Merge System (Same-Type Only) [Score: 85/100]
**Status**: Ready for Dev ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer
**Size**: L (12-16 hours - split into 2 phases)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-19
**Depends On**: None (separate from drag/move)

**What**: Implement Triple Town-style merging - 3 adjacent same-type blocks merge into higher tier
**Why**: Creates strategic gameplay with clear, simple rules that players instantly understand

**Core Mechanic** (Triple Town Model):
- **3+ adjacent blocks** of same type (orthogonal only, not diagonal)
- **Merge triggers** when player moves a block to complete a group of 3+
- **Result appears** at the result position (last-moved block location)
- **Tier progression**: Three Tier-1 blocks ‚Üí One Tier-2 block

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-19):
‚úÖ **APPROVED with architectural refinements**

**Technical Approach**:
- **Event-driven architecture** using MediatR notifications
- **IMergeDetector strategy pattern** for future extensibility
- **Chain-aware from start** (ChainDepth parameter for VS_005)
- **Two-phase implementation** to maintain thin slices

**Architecture Structure**:
```
src/Features/Block/Merge/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Commands/           # MergeCommand with ChainDepth
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Notifications/      # MergeCompletedNotification, BoardChangedNotification  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Services/          # IMergeDetector, AdjacentSameTypeMergeDetector
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Models/            # MergeGroup, MergeResult
```

**Phase 1: Core Merge Logic** (6-8 hours):
1. Create IMergeDetector interface and flood-fill implementation
2. Build MergeCommand/Handler with ChainDepth support (default 0)
3. Add MergeCompletedNotification for future chain detection
4. Implement MergeScoreCalculator (pure function)
5. Comprehensive unit tests (flood-fill, boundaries, scoring)

**Phase 2: Event Integration & UI** (6-8 hours):
1. Implement BoardChangedNotification pattern
2. Create MergeDetectionHandler for automatic triggering
3. Add TurnEndNotification (marks action complete)
4. Wire up Godot UI with MergePresenter
5. Simple visual feedback and score display
6. End-to-end integration testing

**Done When**:
- Moving a block to form 3+ adjacent same-type triggers merge
- Transformed block appears at result position (last-moved location)
- Other blocks in merge group disappear with visual effect
- Score increases and displays (simple text for now)
- Works for all 9 block types (same-type only)
- 8+ unit tests covering detection, execution, and edge cases
- Event notifications ready for VS_004/VS_005 integration

**NOT in Scope** (VS_004+ territory):
- Auto-spawn system (that's next)
- Cross-type merging (2 Work + 1 Study combinations)
- Chain reactions/cascading merges (VS_005)
- Complex animations beyond simple disappear
- Undo functionality

**Technical Risks Identified**:
- Concurrent merges ‚Üí Mitigate with sequential processing
- Performance on large grids ‚Üí Cache flood-fill results
- Turn state management ‚Üí Clear TurnStart/TurnEnd notifications

**Next**: Dev Engineer implements Phase 1, then Test Specialist validates before Phase 2

### VS_004: Auto-Spawn System [Score: 75/100]
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (for breakdown)
**Size**: S (4-6 hours - straightforward mechanic)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-19
**Depends On**: VS_003 (need merging to manage spawned blocks)

**What**: Automatically spawn new blocks at TURN START before player acts (Tetris-style)
**Why**: Creates strategic planning - player must account for new block before moving

**Core Mechanic** (UPDATED - Turn-Based):
- **Spawn Trigger**: At TURN START (before player can act)
- **Turn Flow**: Spawn ‚Üí Player sees board ‚Üí Player acts ‚Üí Merges resolve ‚Üí Turn ends
- **Spawn Count**: 1 block per turn (adjustable for difficulty later)
- **Spawn Position**: Random empty position
- **Spawn Type**: Random from available block types (weighted distribution)
- **Game Over**: When spawn fails due to no empty positions at turn start

**Implementation Approach**:
- Hook into existing command completion (after move/place/merge)
- Find all empty positions on grid
- If empty positions exist: spawn random block type at random position
- If no empty positions: trigger game over state
- Visual feedback for spawned block (appear animation/effect)

**Spawn Distribution** (initial):
- All 9 block types equally weighted (11.1% each)
- Future: Weight based on life stage or difficulty

**Done When**:
- Block spawns after every player action
- Spawns only on empty positions
- Visual indication of newly spawned block
- Game over triggers when grid is full
- Game over screen with final score
- 5+ unit tests for spawn logic
- 2+ tests for game over detection

**NOT in Scope**:
- Difficulty progression (spawn rate increase)
- Weighted spawn probabilities
- Special spawn patterns or rules
- Power-ups to clear spawned blocks
- Spawn preview/prediction
- Multiple spawns per turn
- Life-stage specific spawn rules

**Product Owner Notes**:
- Start with simplest version - one block per turn
- This creates the core gameplay loop: Act ‚Üí Spawn ‚Üí React
- Game over condition finally makes score meaningful
- Must feel fair - random but not cruel

### VS_005: Chain Reaction System [Score: 90/100]
**Status**: Proposed
**Owner**: Product Owner ‚Üí Tech Lead (for breakdown)
**Size**: M (6-8 hours - builds on VS_003 foundation)
**Priority**: Important
**Created**: 2025-08-19
**Depends On**: VS_003 (need basic merging first)

**What**: Add cascading merges that trigger automatically, with exponential scoring multipliers
**Why**: Creates the addictive "YES!" moments that separate good puzzle games from great ones

**Core Mechanic**:
- **Cascade Trigger**: After any merge completes, check if result can trigger new merge
- **Recursive Detection**: Each cascade can trigger another cascade
- **Multiplier System**: Base √ó 1 ‚Üí √ó2 ‚Üí √ó4 ‚Üí √ó8 ‚Üí √ó16 (exponential)
- **Chain Counter**: Display "Chain √ó2!", "Chain √ó3!" etc.
- **Celebration**: Bigger effects for longer chains

**Implementation Approach**:
- After merge completes, run merge detection on result position
- If new merge detected, execute it with increased multiplier
- Continue recursively until no more merges possible
- Track chain depth for scoring and display
- Add brief delay between cascades for visual clarity

**Scoring Formula**:
```
Chain 1: 10 points √ó 1 = 10
Chain 2: 10 points √ó 2 = 20
Chain 3: 10 points √ó 4 = 40
Chain 4: 10 points √ó 8 = 80
Total for 4-chain: 150 points!
```

**Done When**:
- Merges automatically trigger follow-up merges
- Score multiplier increases exponentially per chain
- Chain counter displays during cascades
- Visual delay between cascade steps (player can follow what happened)
- Different sound effects for each chain level
- 5+ unit tests for cascade detection
- 3+ tests for multiplier calculation
- 2+ tests for recursive cascade limits

**NOT in Scope**:
- Special chain-only blocks
- Chain preview/planning UI
- Undo for chains
- Chain-specific animations (use simple for now)
- Maximum chain bonuses/achievements
- Chain-triggered special events

**Critical Design Decisions**:
- **Delay Between Cascades**: 0.3-0.5 seconds (fast enough to feel smooth, slow enough to see)
- **Max Chain Depth**: Unlimited (let players find crazy combos)
- **Multiplier Cap**: No cap initially (see how high players can go)

**Product Owner Notes**:
- This is THE feature that makes match-3 games addictive
- Must feel satisfying - sound/visual feedback crucial
- Exponential scoring rewards elaborate setups
- Creates skill gap between new and experienced players
- Watch for degenerate strategies (infinite chains)

### TD_016: Update All Documentation for Glossary Consistency [Score: 30/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úÖ
**Owner**: Tech Lead ‚Üí Dev Engineer
**Size**: S (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: Important (do before VS_003)
**Created**: 2025-08-19
**Markers**: [DOCUMENTATION] [CONSISTENCY]

**What**: Update all documentation to use glossary terms consistently
**Why**: Inconsistent terminology in personas and docs creates confusion

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-19):
‚úÖ **APPROVED - Critical for VS_003 clarity**
- Backlog itself has inconsistencies (e.g., "level" instead of "tier")
- Persona docs will generate wrong variable names
- Must be done before VS_003 implementation

**Scope of Changes**:
- **Persona docs** (6 files): Update terminology in all persona descriptions
- **Backlog items**: Ensure VS/TD/BR descriptions use correct terms
- **Architecture docs**: Align with glossary vocabulary
- **README/Workflow**: Check for terminology mismatches

**Key Replacements Needed**:
- "match" ‚Üí "merge"
- "level" (for blocks) ‚Üí "tier"
- "round" ‚Üí "turn"
- "cell/slot/tile" ‚Üí "position"
- "combo/cascade" ‚Üí "chain"
- "spawn" (for merge results) ‚Üí "transform"
- "trigger position" ‚Üí "result position"

**Approach**:
1. Grep for anti-pattern terms across Docs/
2. Update each file with correct glossary terms
3. Special attention to persona docs (they guide behavior)
4. Update code comments if found

**Done When**:
- All persona docs use glossary terms
- No anti-pattern terms in active documentation
- Backlog items updated for consistency
- Quick reference guide reflects proper vocabulary

**Tech Lead Note**: This is housekeeping but critical - personas using wrong terms will generate wrong code.



## üí° Ideas (Do Later)
*Nice-to-have features, experimental concepts, future considerations*

### TD_014: Add Property-Based Tests for Swap Mechanic [Score: 45/100]
**Status**: Approved - Immediate Part Ready
**Owner**: Test Specialist  
**Size**: XS (immediate) + M (future property suite)
**Priority**: Ideas (not critical path)
**Created**: 2025-08-19
**Proposed By**: Test Specialist
**Markers**: [QUALITY] [TESTING]

**What**: Implement FSCheck property tests for swap operation invariants
**Why**: Catch edge cases that example-based tests might miss, ensure mathematical properties hold

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ **APPROVED with modifications - Defer to after MVP**

**Analysis**:
- Current swap has only 2 example-based tests
- Property tests would catch edge cases we haven't thought of
- FSCheck is mature and well-suited for game logic invariants
- Swap operation has clear mathematical properties to verify

**However**: 
- We have only 2 swap tests currently - not enough surface area yet
- Property tests shine when you have complex state spaces
- Current swap is relatively simple (range check + position swap)

**Modified Approach**:
1. **Immediate** (5 min): Add 2-3 more example-based tests for critical cases:
   - Swap with boundary blocks (edge of grid)
   - Failed swap attempts (out of range) 
   - Swap with same block (should fail gracefully)
   
**Test Specialist Assignment** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - Tech Lead analysis complete, Test Specialist to implement
- Current swap tests: 2 existing (CompleteDrag_ToOccupiedPosition_WithinRange_ShouldSwapBlocks, CompleteDrag_SwapAtMaxRange_ShouldSucceed)
- Missing coverage: boundary cases, same-block swaps, edge validation
- Test file location: `tests/BlockLife.Core.Tests/Features/Block/Drag/DragCommandTests.cs`
- Follow existing test patterns using BlockBuilder and FluentAssertions

2. **After MVP** (when swap gets complex):
   - Implement full property-based test suite
   - Add generators for game states
   - Test invariants across all block operations

**Rationale**:
- Property tests are valuable but premature optimization now
- With only 2 tests, we need basic coverage first
- When swap mechanics get complex (power-ups, constraints), revisit

**Proposed Properties** (Future Implementation):
```csharp
// 1. Swap preserves total block count
[Property]
public Property SwapOperation_PreservesBlockCount()

// 2. Swap validation is symmetric
[Property]
public Property SwapDistance_IsSymmetric()
// If A can swap with B, then B can swap with A

// 3. Double swap returns to original state
[Property]
public Property DoubleSwap_ReturnsToOriginal()
// Swapping twice = identity operation
```

**Done When**:
- **Immediate**: 2-3 additional example tests added and passing
- **Future**: Property tests integrated with 1000+ generated cases
- Edge cases discovered are documented
- CI pipeline includes property test execution



### TD_009: Refine Persona Command Implementation for Production [Score: 40/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úì
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: Ideas
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during persona system testing
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ APPROVED - Valid improvements but not urgent
- Do after critical items (TD_003, TD_004)
- Focus on error handling and silent mode

**What**: Improve persona command system robustness and user experience
**Why**: Current implementation works but needs refinement for reliable production automation

**Current Issues**:
- Local vs global config precedence unclear and inconsistent
- No error handling for corrupted state files
- Manual testing required to verify which config is active
- Command output verbose for status line usage

**Approach**:
- Add config detection and validation to persona commands
- Implement graceful error handling for missing/corrupted state files
- Create diagnostic commands to show active configuration
- Add silent mode for status line integration (no console output)
- Document config precedence rules clearly

**Technical Improvements**:
- Add `--quiet` flag for status line usage
- Validate .claude/current-persona file format
- Add config source detection (global vs local)
- Implement fallback behavior for missing configs

**Done When**:
- Commands work reliably regardless of config setup
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Silent mode works properly with ccstatusline
- Documentation explains config precedence clearly
- No false negatives in persona detection
