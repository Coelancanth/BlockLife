# BlockLife - Current Implementation Status

*Ground truth of what's actually working vs. what's planned*

**Last Verified**: 2025-08-19 (via code inspection and test review)
**Test Status**: 79 tests passing ‚úÖ

## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop

### ‚úÖ What Players Can Do NOW
1. **Click to place** blocks on a 10x10 grid
2. **Drag blocks** to new positions (3-tile range limit)
3. **Swap blocks** when dragging to occupied spaces
4. **See visual feedback** with color-coded block types
5. **Experience validated moves** (can't place outside grid, overlap blocks, etc.)

### ‚ùå What Players CAN'T Do Yet
- Merge blocks (no combination mechanics)
- Score points (no scoring system)
- Progress through life stages
- Experience time progression
- See narrative/story elements

## üîç Reality Check

### What We Have
**A solid technical foundation** with excellent architecture, clean code, and robust testing. The core grid and block manipulation works perfectly.

### What We Don't Have  
**Any actual game progression** - no scoring, no goals, no win/lose conditions, no progression mechanics. It's a sandbox with blocks.

### The Gap
The Vision.md describes a **deep life simulation game**. The current implementation is a **block manipulation prototype**. The gap is approximately 80-90% of the vision.

### Next Logical Steps (Product Owner Perspective)
Based on what's built, the most valuable next features would be:

1. **Block Merging Mechanics** - We have the logic, need the trigger
2. **Basic Scoring** - Give players a reason to merge
3. **Simple Progression** - Level up or unlock new block types
4. **Win/Lose Conditions** - Grid full = game over
5. **Save/Load** - Let players keep progress

These would transform the prototype into a playable game before tackling the ambitious life simulation features.
