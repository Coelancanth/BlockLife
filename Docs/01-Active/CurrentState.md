# BlockLife - Current Implementation Status

*Ground truth of what's actually working vs. what's planned*

**Last Verified**: 2025-08-19 (via code inspection and test review)
**Test Status**: 79 tests passing ‚úÖ

---

## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop

### ‚úÖ What Players Can Do NOW
1. **Click to place** blocks on a 10x10 grid
2. **Drag blocks** to new positions (3-position range limit)
3. **Swap blocks** when dragging to occupied spaces
4. **See visual feedback** with color-coded block types
5. **Experience validated moves** (can't place outside grid, overlap blocks, etc.)

### ‚ùå What Players CAN'T Do Yet
- Match blocks to earn resources/attributes
- Tier-up blocks (no progression mechanics)
- Transmute blocks (no type conversion)
- Earn bonuses from larger matches
- Receive rewards for achievements
- Progress through life stages
- Experience time progression
- See narrative/story elements

## üîç Reality Check

### What We Have
**A solid technical foundation** with excellent architecture, clean code, and robust testing. The core grid and block manipulation works perfectly.

### What We Don't Have  
**Any actual game progression** - no scoring, no goals, no win/lose conditions, no progression mechanics. It's a sandbox with blocks.

### The Gap
The Vision.md describes a **deep life simulation game**. The current implementation is a **block manipulation prototype**. The gap is approximately 80-90% of the vision.

### Next Logical Steps (Product Owner Perspective)
Based on what's built, the most valuable next features would be:

1. **VS_003A: Match-3 with Resources/Attributes** - Clear blocks to earn Money, Knowledge, Health
2. **VS_003B: Tier System Introduction** - Visual tiers with bonus multipliers
3. **VS_003C: Unlockable Tier-Up** - Spend resources to unlock progression
4. **VS_003D: Cross-Type Transmutation** - Advanced recipes for special blocks
5. **VS_004: Auto-Spawn System** - Grid pressure and game over conditions
6. **VS_005: Chain Reactions** - Cascading matches with exponential bonuses

These would transform the prototype into a playable game before tackling the ambitious life simulation features.
