# BlockLife - Current Implementation Status

*Ground truth of what's actually built and working in the codebase*

**Last Verified**: 2025-08-29 01:00 (via Product Owner review)
**Test Status**: 400+ tests passing ‚úÖ
**Architecture**: Clean VSA with CQRS + LanguageExt functional patterns

## üéÆ Player Experience Reality

### What Players Can ACTUALLY Do Right Now

#### ‚úÖ Core Gameplay Working
1. **Place blocks** on 10x10 grid via click
2. **Drag blocks** to new positions (3-range limit with visual feedback)
3. **Match-3 blocks** to earn resources (automatic pattern detection)
4. **Purchase merge unlocks** via F8 debug panel (100/500/2500 Money)
5. **Merge blocks** into higher tiers (when unlocked, replaces match behavior)
6. **See block information** - type and tier displayed on each block (e.g., "Work T2")
7. **Experience merge animations** - blocks converge, flash, and burst
8. **Track resources** - Money and attributes visible in UI

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Debug-Only Features (Need Player UI)
- **Merge unlock purchases** - Currently requires F8 debug panel
- **Performance profiling** - F9/F10/F11 hotkeys for developers

#### ‚ùå Not Implemented Yet
- **Infant Stage** - Core onboarding experience (VS_010 priority)
- **Dynamic Grid Sizing** - Needed for 4x4 ‚Üí 5x5 growth
- **Parent Block System** - Auto-spawning helper blocks
- **Effect System** - Proximity-based block interactions
- **Save/Load** - No persistence between sessions
- **Life stages progression** - Only infant stage planned currently
- **Narrative events** - No story elements yet

## üèóÔ∏è Vertical Slice Implementation Map

### VS_001: Block Placement & Movement [COMPLETE]
**Player Action Flow:**
```
Click Empty Cell ‚Üí PlaceBlockCommand ‚Üí ValidationRules ‚Üí GridStateService
    ‚Üì Data: Position ‚Üí Block Entity ‚Üí Grid State Update
    ‚úÖ Place, move, swap, remove operations
    ‚úÖ 3-position range validation
    ‚úÖ Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
```

### VS_003A: Match-3 Pattern System [COMPLETE]
**Pattern Recognition Flow:**
```
Block Placed/Moved ‚Üí ProcessPatternsAfterPlacement ‚Üí MatchPatternRecognizer
    ‚Üì Data: Grid State ‚Üí Adjacent Blocks ‚Üí Match Groups (3+)
    ‚Üì Execution: MatchPatternExecutor ‚Üí Remove Blocks ‚Üí Grant Resources
    ‚úÖ Automatic pattern detection on placement/movement
    ‚úÖ Resource rewards (Money: 10√ómultiplier, Attributes: varied)
    ‚úÖ Chain multipliers (√ó1.5 for 4-match, √ó2.0 for 5-match)
```

### VS_003B: Merge Pattern System [COMPLETE]
**Merge Unlock & Execution Flow:**
```
Player Has Money ‚Üí F8 Debug Panel ‚Üí PurchaseMergeUnlockCommand
    ‚Üì Data: MaxUnlockedTier Update (T1‚ÜíT2, costs 100 Money)
    
When T2+ Unlocked ‚Üí Pattern Recognition Changes:
    Same blocks detected ‚Üí MergePatternExecutor (replaces MatchPatternExecutor)
    ‚Üì Data: 3 T1 blocks ‚Üí 1 T2 block at center position
    ‚Üì Visual: Convergence animation ‚Üí Flash ‚Üí Burst effect
    ‚úÖ Progressive unlock system (T2: 100, T3: 500, T4: 2500)
    ‚úÖ Merge REPLACES match behavior when unlocked
```

### VS_006: Core Turn System [COMPLETE]
**Implemented**: Turn counter, proper action flow, spawn‚Üíaction‚Üíresolve cycle
**Result**: Foundation for game pacing established

### VS_007: Auto-Spawn System [COMPLETE]
**Implemented**: Blocks spawn each turn, full domain/handler/state implementation
**Note**: UI polish deferred for post-prototype

### VS_010: Infant Stage Foundation [PROPOSED - CRITICAL]
**Product Owner Priority**: Natural tutorial through baby metaphor
- 4x4 grid expanding to 5x5 (baby growing)
- Parent blocks that help when baby struggles
- Need/Care matching mechanic
- No failure state - infinite exploration
**Awaiting**: Tech Lead feasibility review

## üîå Core Systems Status

### Pattern Framework
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Extensible pattern recognition and execution
- IPatternRecognizer interface for detection
- IPatternResolver for execution selection
- IPatternExecutor for pattern execution
- Supports match, merge, and future patterns

### Resource Economy
‚úÖ **FUNCTIONAL** - Basic resource tracking and rewards
- Money from Work blocks
- Knowledge from Study blocks
- Attributes tracked in PlayerDataService
‚ö†Ô∏è **Hardcoded Values** - Will migrate to resources in VS_008

### Grid Management
‚úÖ **SOLID** - 10x10 grid with full CRUD operations
- GridStateService maintains state
- Position validation and range checking
- Visual feedback for valid moves

### Command/Query Architecture
‚úÖ **ROBUST** - Clean separation of concerns
- Commands modify state
- Queries read without side effects
- Notifications for cross-cutting concerns
- Full MediatR integration

## üéØ Next Logical Steps

1. **TD_089: Analytics Foundation** (Critical) - Need data before more features
2. **VS_010: Infant Stage** (Critical) - Natural onboarding through baby metaphor
3. **TD_081: Test Coverage** (Important) - Ensure merge system reliability

**Strategic Pivot**: Emotional engagement over mechanical complexity. The infant stage provides a perfect tutorial that doesn't feel like one.

## üîç Reality Check

**What's Working Well:**
- Clean architecture holding up under growth
- Pattern framework easily extensible
- Test coverage preventing regressions
- Functional programming reducing bugs

**What Needs Attention:**
- Player-facing UI for unlocks (debug panel only)
- Complex mechanics before proving fun (avoiding with infant stage)
- Hardcoded values slow balancing
- Need emotional hook for player retention
