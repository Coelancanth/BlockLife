## 🚨 Critical Gaps
**NONE** - All active items are in good standing with proper ownership and recent creation dates

## ⏰ Stale Reviews (>3 days)
**NONE** - All active items created within last 24 hours (2025-08-20)

## 👤 Missing Owners
**NONE** - All items have assigned owners:
- TD_037: DevOps Engineer ✅
- TD_030: DevOps Engineer ✅
- TD_031: DevOps Engineer ✅
- TD_033: Tech Lead ✅
- TD_032: DevOps Engineer ✅

## 🔄 Ownership Mismatches
**NONE** - All ownership assignments follow rules:
- TD items with "Proposed" status correctly owned by Tech Lead (TD_033) ✅
- TD items with "Approved" status correctly owned by DevOps Engineer (TD_037, TD_030, TD_031, TD_032) ✅

## 🚧 Blocked Dependencies
**MINOR**: 1 item has dependency consideration:
- TD_033: Depends on TD_029, TD_030 (to learn from implementation)
  - TD_029: **RESOLVED** - Now obsolete, dependency should be updated
  - TD_030: **APPROVED** - In DevOps queue, normal dependency

## 📋 Additional Observations

### Positive Trends
- Clean backlog after archival of obsolete items (BR_012, TD_029)
- All items have proper size estimates and priority assignments
- Strong ownership distribution with clear personas
- Recent creation dates indicate active management

### Recommended Actions
1. **Update TD_033 dependencies** - Remove obsolete TD_029 reference
2. **DevOps workload review** - 4 of 5 active items assigned to DevOps Engineer
3. **Monitor TD_037 progress** - Critical infrastructure item blocking persona system

### Archive Summary
Successfully archived 2 obsolete items:
- BR_012: Git Worktree Branch Conflict (RESOLVED via architecture change)
- TD_029: Main Directory Protection (OBSOLETE after worktree elimination)

## Next Review Recommended
**Date**: 2025-08-24 (3 days)
**Focus**: DevOps Engineer workload completion, TD_037 critical path progress
