## 🔄 Document Lifecycle

### Update Triggers
Living documents should be updated when:
- **New Incidents**: Relevant bugs/issues provide new insights
- **Pattern Changes**: Architectural patterns evolve or improve
- **Tool Updates**: New tools or procedures are adopted
- **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident reviews reveal improvements

### Update Process
1. **Agent Responsibility**: Domain owner agent updates their documents
2. **Version Tracking**: Evolution History section tracks changes
3. **Cross-References**: Related documents updated with new links
4. **Index Updates**: This index updated to reflect changes

### Quality Standards
- **Actionable**: All guidance must be specific and implementable
- **Tested**: All patterns validated through actual use
- **Current**: Regular review to ensure information remains accurate
- **Complete**: Sufficient detail for independent execution

## 🎯 Usage Patterns

### For Development Teams
1. **Pre-Feature**: Review relevant playbooks before starting work
2. **During Development**: Use troubleshooting guides when issues arise
3. **Pre-Production**: Run through production readiness checklist
4. **Post-Incident**: Update relevant documents with new learnings

### For AI Agents
1. **Domain Expertise**: Each agent maintains documents in their specialty
2. **Quick Reference**: Use this index to find relevant guidance quickly
3. **Cross-Domain**: Reference other agents' documents when needed
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Update documents after each incident

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Documentation Health
- **Currency**: All documents updated within 30 days of related incidents
- **Usage**: Referenced in at least 80% of development workflows
- **Completeness**: All major failure modes covered by guidance
- **Accuracy**: Zero incidents caused by following documented procedures

### Knowledge Evolution
- **Learning Velocity**: Time from incident to documented prevention < 1 week
- **Pattern Recognition**: Similar incidents prevented by existing guidance
- **Cross-Pollination**: Lessons from one domain applied to others
- **Institutional Memory**: Knowledge preserved despite team changes

## 🔍 Search and Discovery

### By Failure Mode
- **Thread Safety Issues**: LWP_001, LWP_004
- **UI Not Updating**: LWT_001, LWP_002
- **Memory Leaks**: LWP_001, LWP_004
- **Integration Test Failures**: LWP_002
- **Performance Issues**: LWP_001, LWP_004

### By Development Phase
- **Feature Planning**: LWP_004 (Production Readiness)
- **Implementation**: LWP_002 (Integration Patterns)
- **Testing**: LWP_001 (Stress Testing)
- **Debugging**: LWT_001 (Notification Pipeline)
- **Pre-Production**: LWP_004 (Readiness Checklist)

## 🚀 Migration Status

### Completed Transformations
- ✅ **Architecture_Stress_Testing_Lessons_Learned.md** → LWP_001 (Enhanced with Critical Findings)
