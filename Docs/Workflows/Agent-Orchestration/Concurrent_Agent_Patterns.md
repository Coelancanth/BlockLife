## ðŸŽ¯ When to Use Concurrent Agents

### **Complexity Indicators**
- **Multi-domain problems** - Issue spans architecture, testing, and implementation
- **Time-critical projects** - Need to compress development timeline
- **Complex investigations** - Root cause unknown, multiple potential factors
- **Major feature development** - Requirements, design, and testing can proceed in parallel
- **Performance/reliability issues** - Multiple analysis approaches needed

### **Cost/Benefit Analysis**
```
Sequential Approach: 4 agents Ã— 30 minutes = 2 hours
Concurrent Approach: 4 agents Ã— 30 minutes parallel = 45 minutes (including synthesis)

Benefits:
+ 60%+ time compression
+ Cross-pollination of expert insights
+ Built-in validation through diverse perspectives
+ Reduced risk of single-perspective blind spots

Costs:
+ Main agent orchestration complexity
+ Potential expert recommendation conflicts
+ Synthesis and integration overhead
```

## ðŸ”„ Core Orchestration Patterns

### **Pattern 1: Parallel Investigation**

**Use Case**: "System performance is degrading"

**Orchestration Strategy**:
```
Main Agent decomposes into 3 independent analyses:

debugger-expert:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Systematic performance profiling and bottleneck identification"  
â”œâ”€ Focus: "Notification pipeline timing, memory allocations, thread contention"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Root cause analysis with specific performance bottlenecks"

architect:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Review architecture patterns for scalability limitations"
â”œâ”€ Focus: "GridStateService concurrent access, CQRS command flow efficiency"  
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Architecture optimization recommendations with impact assessment"

qa-engineer:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Design comprehensive performance test suite"
â”œâ”€ Focus: "100+ concurrent block operations, stress testing scenarios"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Test suite revealing performance characteristics under load"

â†’ Main Agent synthesizes findings into unified optimization plan
```

### **Pattern 2: Multi-Phase Concurrent Development**

**Use Case**: "Implement complex inventory system"

**Phase 1: Concurrent Requirements & Design**
```
product-owner:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Create comprehensive user stories and acceptance criteria"
â”œâ”€ Context: "Existing game mechanics, player expectations"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "VS_004 work item with complete requirements specification"

architect:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Design inventory data model and integration architecture"  
â”œâ”€ Context: "Existing GridStateService patterns, Clean Architecture boundaries"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "ADR with technical approach and integration patterns"

â†’ Parallel execution, results feed into Phase 2
```

**Phase 2: Concurrent Implementation Planning**
```
test-designer:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Design comprehensive test strategy for inventory system"
â”œâ”€ Context: "User stories from Phase 1, architecture decisions from Phase 1"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Test plan with unit, integration, and edge case coverage"

tech-lead:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Create detailed implementation roadmap and task breakdown"
â”œâ”€ Context: "Requirements and architecture from Phase 1"  
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Phase-based implementation plan for dev-engineer execution"

â†’ Results synthesized into execution-ready development plan
```

### **Pattern 3: Concurrent Problem Resolution**

**Use Case**: "Block placement fails intermittently"

**Multi-Angle Investigation**:
```
debugger-expert:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Reproduce and systematically diagnose intermittent failure"
â”œâ”€ Focus: "Race conditions, timing issues, state synchronization"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Root cause analysis with reproduction steps"

qa-engineer:  
â”œâ”€ Task: "Design comprehensive validation test suite for placement"
â”œâ”€ Focus: "Edge cases, stress conditions, concurrent operations"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Test suite that reveals failure conditions"

architect:
â”œâ”€ Task: "Review placement pipeline architecture for reliability issues"
â”œâ”€ Focus: "Command/Handler flow, notification pipeline, error handling"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Architecture recommendations for improved reliability"

â†’ Synthesis produces both immediate fix and long-term reliability improvements
```

## ðŸŽ­ Main Agent Orchestration Responsibilities

### **1. Task Decomposition**

**Identify Independent Concerns**:
```python
def decompose_complex_request(request):
    concerns = analyze_request_domains(request)
    
    # Example for "Add inventory system":
    return {
        'requirements': 'User stories and acceptance criteria',
        'architecture': 'Data model and integration patterns', 
        'testing': 'Test strategy and edge case identification',
        'implementation': 'Phase-based development roadmap'
    }
    
    # Map to appropriate specialists
    agent_assignments = {
        'requirements': 'product-owner',
        'architecture': 'architect',
        'testing': 'test-designer', 
        'implementation': 'tech-lead'
    }
```

### **2. Context Packaging**

**Ensure Consistent Base Knowledge**:
```markdown
## Standard Context Package for All Agents

### Project Context
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture + CQRS + MVP pattern
- **Technology**: C# + Godot 4.4 + LanguageExt.Core
- **Reference**: Copy patterns from `src/Features/Block/Move/`
- **Constraints**: Solo development, simplicity bias

### Domain-Specific Context
- **debugger-expert**: Current system state, recent changes, error logs
- **architect**: Existing patterns, technical debt, integration points
- **test-designer**: Current test coverage, known edge cases, testing frameworks
- **tech-lead**: Team velocity, existing estimates, dependency constraints
```

### **3. Conflict Resolution Framework**

**When Expert Recommendations Conflict**:
```
1. IDENTIFY the nature of conflict
   - Technical approach differences
   - Complexity vs. simplicity tradeoffs  
   - Timeline vs. quality considerations

2. APPLY decision criteria in order:
   a) Simplicity bias - simpler solution wins
   b) Existing patterns - follow established approaches
   c) Solo dev constraints - minimize maintenance overhead
   d) User value - maximize delivered benefit

3. DOCUMENT the resolution rationale
4. UPDATE all affected expert recommendations
5. ENSURE all agents understand the unified approach
```

### **4. Quality Integration**

**Synthesis Process**:
```
1. VALIDATE each expert deliverable against success criteria
2. CHECK for internal consistency within each expert's recommendation  
3. IDENTIFY synergies and conflicts between expert outputs
4. RESOLVE conflicts using established decision framework
5. CREATE unified action plan integrating all expert insights
6. VERIFY final plan is executable and maintains quality standards
```

## ðŸ“‹ Practical Implementation Examples

### **Example 1: Performance Optimization Project**

**Initial Request**: "Block placement is getting slower as the game progresses"

**Concurrent Investigation Plan**:
```
Agent Assignments:
â”œâ”€ debugger-expert â†’ Identify specific performance bottlenecks
â”œâ”€ architect â†’ Review scalability patterns and limitations  
â””â”€ qa-engineer â†’ Create performance benchmarking suite

Context Package:
â”œâ”€ Recent performance complaints from testing
â”œâ”€ Current GridStateService implementation patterns
â”œâ”€ Existing Move Block reference implementation
â””â”€ Target: 60fps with 1000+ blocks placed

Expected Timeline: 45 minutes parallel execution + 15 minutes synthesis
```

**Agent Deliverables**:
```
debugger-expert Result:
"ROOT CAUSE: GridStateService.GetBlockAt() performs O(n) search through all blocks.
EVIDENCE: Profiling shows 80% CPU time in block lookup during placement validation.
FIX: Replace List<Block> with Dictionary<Vector2Int, Block> for O(1) lookup."

architect Result:  
"RECOMMENDATION: Implement spatial indexing pattern for grid operations.
PATTERN: Dictionary-based spatial index with coordinate keys.
INTEGRATION: Fits existing GridStateService, minimal API changes required."

qa-engineer Result:
"PERFORMANCE TEST SUITE: Benchmark placement operations at 100, 500, 1000, 5000 blocks.
BASELINE: Current O(n) performance degrades linearly with block count.
TARGET: O(1) lookup should maintain constant time regardless of block count."
```

**Main Agent Synthesis**:
```
UNIFIED PLAN:
1. Implement Dictionary<Vector2Int, Block> spatial index in GridStateService
2. Maintain existing API compatibility for minimal integration impact
3. Add performance regression tests to prevent future degradation
4. Target: <1ms placement validation regardless of block count

IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY:
1. Core dictionary implementation (debugger-expert recommendation)
2. Architecture integration (architect pattern)  
3. Performance validation (qa-engineer test suite)

QUALITY GATES:
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Performance tests show O(1) characteristics
- Manual testing confirms 60fps maintained with 5000+ blocks
```

â”œâ”€ Context: "All Phase 1 results plus test strategy"
â””â”€ Deliverable: "Phase-based development plan for dev-engineer execution"

Timeline: 30 minutes parallel execution
```

**Synthesis Result**:
```
INTEGRATED DEVELOPMENT PLAN:
- User Requirements: 5 core user stories with measurable acceptance criteria
- Technical Architecture: InventoryService following GridStateService patterns
- Test Strategy: 15 unit tests, 8 integration tests, 3 UX validation scenarios
- Implementation: 4-phase development (Domain â†’ Services â†’ Presentation â†’ Integration)
