# Workflow Evolution Archives

These documents capture the historical evolution of the persona workflow implementation from ADR-004.

## Archived Documents

- **simple-persona-workflow.md** - Early manual approach where users ran scripts directly
- **elegant-persona-workflow.md** - Automated approach where Claude runs scripts

## Why Archived?

1. **Not Referenced**: Neither document is referenced anywhere in the active codebase
2. **Superseded**: The current implementation is documented in CLAUDE.md 
3. **Confusion Prevention**: Both incorrectly labeled themselves as "ADR-004" when the actual ADR is in `Docs/03-Reference/ADR/ADR-004-single-repo-persona-context-management.md`
4. **Historical Value**: Preserved here to document the learning journey from manual to automated workflows

## Current Implementation

The active persona workflow is now documented in:
- **CLAUDE.md** - "Streamlined Persona System with v4.0 Auto-Sync" section
- **ADR-004** - Architectural decision for single-repo context management
- **embody.ps1** - The unified script that handles everything

## Key Insight

The evolution from simple â†’ elegant workflow revealed that Claude Code can automatically run scripts when users say "embody [persona]", eliminating all manual steps. This insight led to the current zero-friction workflow.
