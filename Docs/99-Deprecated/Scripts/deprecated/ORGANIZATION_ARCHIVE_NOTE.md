# ORGANIZATION.md Archive Note

**Archived**: 2025-08-21  
**Reason**: Proposed structure never implemented, creating documentation-reality mismatch

## What it was:
Detailed proposal for elaborate directory structure with:
- `git/` directory for hooks
- `test/`, `dev/`, `deploy/`, `utils/` directories  
- Complex organizational hierarchy

## Why archived:
1. **Never implemented** - described structure that didn't exist
2. **Over-engineering** - proposed complex structure for simple needs
3. **Documentation debt** - caused confusion by not matching reality
4. **Replaced by** - Practical structure documented in main README.md

## Lessons learned:
- Document what IS, not what might be
- Implement first, then document
- Simple structures beat elaborate proposals
- Keep documentation synchronized with reality

The current structure is simple, effective, and matches the actual project needs.
