**Last Updated**: 2025-08-17

## ðŸ”¥ Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*


## ðŸ“ˆ Important (Do Next)  
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

- **TD_005**: Debugger-expert agent workflow improvement (analyze evidence before implementing solutions)
- **VS_001**: Block drag-and-drop interaction system (replace click-to-move)
- **TD_003**: Block movement range validation and constraints  
- **TD_004**: Block swap functionality for occupied positions

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Reference

**Priority Decision Framework:**
1. **Blocking other work?** â†’ ðŸ”¥ Critical
2. **Current milestone?** â†’ ðŸ“ˆ Important  
3. **Everything else** â†’ ðŸ’¡ Ideas

**Work Item Types:**
- **VS_xxx**: Vertical Slice (new feature) - Product Owner creates
- **BR_xxx**: Bug Report (investigation) - Test Specialist creates, Debugger owns
- **TD_xxx**: Technical Debt (refactoring) - Anyone proposes â†’ Tech Lead approves

*Notes:*
- *Critical bugs are BR items with ðŸ”¥ priority*
- *TD items need Tech Lead approval to move from "Proposed" to actionable*
