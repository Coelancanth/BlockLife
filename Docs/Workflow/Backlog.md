# BlockLife Development Backlog

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-18

## üìñ How to Use This Backlog

### üß† Owner-Based Ultra-Think Protocol

**Each item has a single Owner persona responsible for decisions and progress.**

#### When You Embody a Persona:
1. **Filter** for items where `Owner: [Your Persona]`
2. **Ultra-Think** if `Status: Proposed` and you're the owner (5-15 min deep analysis)
3. **Quick Scan** for other statuses you own (<2 min updates)
4. **Update** the backlog before ending your session
5. **Reassign** owner when handing off to next persona

#### Ultra-Think Triggers:
- **Automatic**: When you own a "Proposed" item
- **Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE], [ROOT-CAUSE], [SAFETY-CRITICAL], [COMPLEX]
- **Output**: Document decision rationale directly in the item

### Default Ownership Rules
| Item Type | Status | Default Owner | Next Owner |
|-----------|--------|---------------|------------|
| **VS** | Proposed | Product Owner | ‚Üí Tech Lead (breakdown) |
| **VS** | Approved | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (implement) |
| **BR** | New | Test Specialist | ‚Üí Debugger Expert (complex) |
| **TD** | Proposed | Tech Lead | ‚Üí Dev Engineer (approved) |

### Pragmatic Documentation Approach
- **Quick items (<1 day)**: 5-10 lines inline below
- **Medium items (1-3 days)**: 15-30 lines inline (like VS_001-003 below)
- **Complex items (>3 days)**: Create separate doc and link here

**Rule**: Start inline. Only extract to separate doc if it grows beyond 30 lines or needs diagrams.

## üî• Critical (Do First)
*Blockers preventing other work, production bugs, dependencies for other features*

### BR_002: Investigate Severe Memory Leak - 49GB Usage
**Status**: New
**Owner**: Debugger Expert ‚Üê Dev Engineer (discovered)
**Size**: L (investigation unknown)
**Priority**: Critical üî•
**Created**: 2025-08-18 12:42 PM
**Markers**: [PERFORMANCE] [BLOCKING] [ROOT-CAUSE]

**What**: Investigate and fix memory leak causing 49GB RAM usage (77% of 64GB)
**Why**: Blocking developer productivity, potential test runner crash, resource exhaustion

**Symptoms Observed**:
- Memory usage: ~49GB (77% of 64GB system RAM) reported
- BUT: No single process using excessive memory (Godot: 1.2GB)
- Suggests: File cache, closed processes, or already released
- May be intermittent during heavy test runs

**Initial Suspects** (Dev Engineer hypothesis):
1. **Test Runner Memory Leaks**:
   - Property-based tests running 100s of iterations
   - ServiceProvider not disposed between tests
   - Test fixtures holding references

2. **Event Subscription Leaks**:
   - DragPresenter events not unsubscribed (lines 43-46, 54-57)
   - WeakEventManager issues
   - View-Presenter circular references

3. **Static Collections**:
   - GridStateService might be accumulating state
   - Logger buffering messages indefinitely
   - MediatR handler caching

**Immediate Actions Needed**:
- [ ] Profile memory with dotMemory or PerfView
- [ ] Check for IDisposable implementations missing Dispose calls
- [ ] Audit event subscriptions for missing unsubscribe
- [ ] Review static collections and caches
- [ ] Check test cleanup methods

**Success Criteria**:
- Memory usage under 2GB during normal development
- No memory growth during test runs
- Clean memory release after test completion

## üìà Important (Do Next)  
*Core features for current milestone, technical debt affecting velocity*

### VS_001 Phase 2: Drag Range Limits [Score: 85/100]
**Status**: Ready for Review üîç
**Owner**: Test Specialist (for validation) ‚Üê Dev Engineer (implementation complete)
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)
**Branch**: feat/drag-to-move-blocks

**What**: Add movement range validation to drag system
**Why**: Prevents unrealistic teleportation, adds strategic depth

**Dev Engineer Implementation Summary** (2025-08-18):
- ‚úÖ Enabled range validation in DragPresenter.cs:206-213
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators already working in DragView.cs:304-327
- ‚úÖ Manhattan distance calculation in DragStateService.cs:96-108
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive test suite: DragRangeValidationTests.cs (14 tests passing)
- ‚úÖ All existing tests still pass

**Technical Decisions Made**:
- Used Manhattan distance (grid-based) instead of Chebyshev (diagonal)
- Default range: 3 cells (configurable via GetDragRange method)
- Range enforcement happens at both drag update and completion

**Ready for Test Specialist Validation**:
- Implementation follows existing patterns from Phase 1
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance impact minimal (simple distance calculation)

**Phase 3 - Swap Mechanic** (future):
- Detect drop on occupied cell
- Swap both blocks with animation
- Validate swap against both block ranges

### TD_013: Refactor Range Validation to Shape-Based System [Score: 80/100]
**Status**: Proposed 
**Owner**: Tech Lead (for approval) ‚Üê Dev Engineer (proposed)
**Size**: M (6-8 hours)
**Priority**: Important (blocks Phase 3 and future movement patterns)
**Created**: 2025-08-18
**Markers**: [ARCHITECTURE] [EXTENSIBILITY]

**What**: Replace hard-coded range validation with extensible shape system
**Why**: Current Manhattan distance is just one shape - need flexibility for different movement patterns

**Dev Engineer Analysis** (2025-08-18):
- **Current Issue**: IsWithinDragRange uses hard-coded Manhattan distance
- **Opportunity**: Create IMovementShape interface with implementations
- **Enables**: Diamond (Manhattan), Square (Chebyshev), Cross, L-shape, Custom patterns
- **Impact**: More intuitive, extensible, game-design friendly

**Proposed Approach**:
```csharp
interface IMovementShape {
    bool IsValidMove(Vector2Int from, Vector2Int to);
    IEnumerable<Vector2Int> GetValidPositions(Vector2Int from);
}
```
- DiamondShape: Manhattan distance (current)
- SquareShape: Chebyshev distance 
- CrossShape: Cardinal directions only
- Custom shapes for special blocks

**Benefits**:
- Each block type can have different movement patterns
- Visual indicators match actual movement shape
- Extensible without changing core logic
- Better game design flexibility

**Risks**:
- More complex than simple range check
- Need to update UI shape rendering
- Test complexity increases

**Recommendation**: Implement BEFORE Phase 3 since swap mechanics will depend on movement shapes

### TD_005: Add Missing Drag Integration Tests [Score: 75/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úì
**Owner**: Test Specialist
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: Test Specialist during VS_001 Phase 1 review

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ APPROVED - Valid gap in test coverage
- Need end-to-end validation before Phase 2
- Create GdUnit4 tests following existing patterns

**What**: Create GdUnit4 integration tests for drag operations
**Why**: Only unit tests exist, need end-to-end validation before UI hookup

**Approach**:
- Create `tests/GdUnit4/Features/Block/Drag/DragIntegrationTest.cs`
- Test complete drag flow from UI to state changes
- Add stress test for concurrent drag attempts
- Add performance test for 60fps requirement

**Done When**:
- Integration tests cover all drag scenarios
- Stress test validates no race conditions
- Performance test confirms <16ms operations

### TD_006: Separate Performance Tests from CI Pipeline [Score: 70/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úì
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during CI failure investigation

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ APPROVED - Smart CI improvement, 100% false positive rate unacceptable
- Add [Category("Performance")] attribute
- Update CI workflow to exclude timing tests
- Create optional performance pipeline

**What**: Create separate test category for performance tests and exclude from main CI
**Why**: Timing tests cause false failures in virtualized CI environments (100% false positive rate)
**Related**: PostMortem_2025-01-17-CI-Timing-Tests.md

**Approach**:
- Add [Category("Performance")] to all timing-sensitive tests
- Update CI workflow to exclude Performance category
- Create optional performance test pipeline (non-blocking)
- Add CI environment detection helper

**Done When**:
- Performance tests properly categorized
- Main CI excludes timing tests
- Optional performance pipeline exists
- No more timing-related CI failures

**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during status line configuration
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Nice-to-have convenience feature
- Not blocking any real work
- Developers can use `git status` for now

**Strategic Prioritizer Decision** (2025-08-18):
üí° CONFIRMED IN IDEAS - Score: 12/100
- Pure convenience, no business value
- Workaround exists (git status)
- Keep for future quality-of-life improvements

**What**: Fix ccstatusline showing "no git" instead of current branch in Claude Code status line
**Why**: Developers lose git context awareness, affecting workflow efficiency and branch management

**Problem Statement**:
- ccstatusline displays "‚éá no git" instead of actual branch name
- Working directory is correctly in git repository root
- Git commands work normally but status line shows incorrect information
- Affects situational awareness during development

**Approach**:
- Investigate ccstatusline git detection logic in Claude Code context
- Test working directory resolution when executed via Claude settings
- Fix path/environment issues preventing git repository detection
- Verify git integration works in both global and local config modes

**Done When**:
- Status line shows correct git branch: "üåø docs/improve-git-workflow-documentation"
- Git branch updates when switching branches
- Works consistently in Claude Code status line integration

### TD_009: Refine Persona Command Implementation for Production [Score: 40/100]
**Status**: Approved ‚úì
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: Ideas
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during persona system testing
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**Tech Lead Decision** (2025-08-18):
‚úÖ APPROVED - Valid improvements but not urgent
- Do after critical items (TD_003, TD_004)
- Focus on error handling and silent mode

**What**: Improve persona command system robustness and user experience
**Why**: Current implementation works but needs refinement for reliable production automation

**Current Issues**:

- Manual testing required to verify which config is active
- Command output verbose for status line usage

**Approach**:
- Add config detection and validation to persona commands
- Implement graceful error handling for missing/corrupted state files
- Create diagnostic commands to show active configuration
- Add silent mode for status line integration (no console output)
- Document config precedence rules clearly

**Technical Improvements**:
- Add `--quiet` flag for status line usage
- Validate .claude/current-persona file format
- Add config source detection (global vs local)
- Implement fallback behavior for missing configs

**Done When**:
- Commands work reliably regardless of config setup
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Silent mode works properly with ccstatusline
- Documentation explains config precedence clearly
- No false negatives in persona detection
