## üí° Ideas (Do Later)
*Nice-to-have features, experimental concepts, future considerations*

### TD_001: Extract Input System to Separate Feature Module
**Status**: Approved ‚úì
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Ideas (after VS_001)
**Tech Lead**: Valid architectural improvement. Implement after VS_001 to understand full requirements.

**Approach**:
- Create `src/Features/Input/` module
- Extract common input handling patterns
- Centralize input state management
- Follow existing feature module structure

### TD_002: [Deferred] Performance Optimization for Drag Visualization
**Status**: Not Approved ‚ùå
**Tech Lead**: Premature optimization. No performance issues identified yet.
**Action**: Only revisit if profiling shows actual performance problems during VS_001 implementation.

### TD_003: Fix Async Void Anti-Pattern in DragPresenter (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: S (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: Test Specialist during VS_001 Phase 1 review

**What**: Replace async void event handlers with proper async patterns in DragPresenter
**Why**: Async void methods swallow exceptions and can't be awaited, hiding failures
**Location**: `src/Features/Block/Drag/Presenters/DragPresenter.cs` lines 62, 124, 159

**Approach**:
- Convert to async Task with try-catch error logging
- Or use fire-and-forget pattern with proper error handling
- Ensure exceptions are logged and don't crash the app

**Done When**:
- All async void methods replaced
- Exceptions properly caught and logged
- Tests verify error handling works

### TD_004: Add Thread Safety to DragStateService (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed  
**Size**: S (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: Test Specialist during VS_001 Phase 1 review

**What**: Make DragStateService state mutations thread-safe
**Why**: Check-and-set operations aren't atomic, could cause race conditions
**Location**: `src/Features/Block/Drag/Services/DragStateService.cs` lines 32-36

**Approach**:
- Add lock around state mutations
- Or use atomic operations with Interlocked
- Ensure singleton access is thread-safe

**Done When**:
- State mutations are atomic
- Stress test with 100 concurrent operations passes
- No race conditions possible

### TD_005: Add Missing Drag Integration Tests (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: Test Specialist during VS_001 Phase 1 review

**What**: Create GdUnit4 integration tests for drag operations
**Why**: Only unit tests exist, need end-to-end validation before UI hookup

**Approach**:
- Create `tests/GdUnit4/Features/Block/Drag/DragIntegrationTest.cs`
- Test complete drag flow from UI to state changes
- Add stress test for concurrent drag attempts
- Add performance test for 60fps requirement

**Done When**:
- Integration tests cover all drag scenarios
- Stress test validates no race conditions
- Performance test confirms <16ms operations

### TD_006: Separate Performance Tests from CI Pipeline (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during CI failure investigation

**What**: Create separate test category for performance tests and exclude from main CI
**Why**: Timing tests cause false failures in virtualized CI environments (100% false positive rate)
**Related**: PostMortem_2025-01-17-CI-Timing-Tests.md

**Approach**:
- Add [Category("Performance")] to all timing-sensitive tests
- Update CI workflow to exclude Performance category
- Create optional performance test pipeline (non-blocking)
- Add CI environment detection helper

**Done When**:
- Performance tests properly categorized
- Main CI excludes timing tests
- Optional performance pipeline exists
- No more timing-related CI failures

### TD_007: Multi-Persona Git Worktree Workflow System (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: XL (>3 days - needs detailed planning)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: Workflow analysis during branch cleanup 
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**What**: Implement Git worktree-based workflow system for multi-terminal persona development
**Why**: Current workflow creates git state conflicts when multiple terminals embody different personas, causing lost work and confusion

**Problem Statement**:
- Multiple terminals sharing single .git causes branch switching conflicts
- Persona work gets lost when other terminals change branches
- Uncommitted changes disappear when switching contexts
- No clear separation between persona work and feature development
- Branch cleanup is dangerous without knowing what work exists in other terminals

**Proposed Solution**: Git Worktree Persona Isolation
- Each persona gets dedicated working directory with isolated git state
- Shared repository for commits/branches, isolated working trees
- Clean separation between persona context and feature work
- Safe cleanup protocols that don't affect active persona work

**Tech Lead Review Required**:
- Is this architectural change worth the complexity?
- How does this affect our current git workflow documentation?
- What's the migration strategy for existing development?
- Does this solve a real problem or add unnecessary overhead?

**Detailed Planning Needed**:
- Directory structure design
- Setup automation scripts  
- Integration with existing CLAUDE.md workflows
- Documentation updates required
- Training/onboarding for team
- Cleanup and maintenance procedures

**Next Steps**:
1. Tech Lead architectural review and approval
2. Create detailed implementation plan if approved
3. Break into smaller, phased implementation tasks
4. Update all workflow documentation

### TD_008: Fix ccstatusline Git Branch Display Issue (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: S (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during status line configuration
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**What**: Fix ccstatusline showing "no git" instead of current branch in Claude Code status line
**Why**: Developers lose git context awareness, affecting workflow efficiency and branch management

**Problem Statement**:
- ccstatusline displays "‚éá no git" instead of actual branch name
- Working directory is correctly in git repository root
- Git commands work normally but status line shows incorrect information
- Affects situational awareness during development

**Approach**:
- Investigate ccstatusline git detection logic in Claude Code context
- Test working directory resolution when executed via Claude settings
- Fix path/environment issues preventing git repository detection
- Verify git integration works in both global and local config modes

**Done When**:
- Status line shows correct git branch: "üåø docs/improve-git-workflow-documentation"
- Git branch updates when switching branches
- Works consistently in Claude Code status line integration

### TD_009: Refine Persona Command Implementation for Production (Proposed)
**Status**: Proposed
**Size**: M (4-6 hours)  
**Priority**: Important
**Found By**: DevOps Engineer during persona system testing
**Created**: 2025-08-18

**What**: Improve persona command system robustness and user experience
**Why**: Current implementation works but needs refinement for reliable production automation

**Current Issues**:
- Local vs global config precedence unclear and inconsistent
- No error handling for corrupted state files
- Manual testing required to verify which config is active
- Command output verbose for status line usage

**Approach**:
- Add config detection and validation to persona commands
- Implement graceful error handling for missing/corrupted state files
- Create diagnostic commands to show active configuration
- Add silent mode for status line integration (no console output)
- Document config precedence rules clearly

**Technical Improvements**:
- Add `--quiet` flag for status line usage
- Validate .claude/current-persona file format
- Add config source detection (global vs local)
- Implement fallback behavior for missing configs

**Done When**:
- Commands work reliably regardless of config setup
- Clear error messages for configuration issues
- Silent mode works properly with ccstatusline
- Documentation explains config precedence clearly
- No false negatives in persona detection
