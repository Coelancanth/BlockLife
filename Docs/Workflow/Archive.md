#### BR_007: Backlog-Assistant Automation Misuse ✅ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: Debugger Expert
**Effort**: S (2 hours)
**Original Issue**: Personas were automatically calling backlog-assistant instead of user explicitly invoking it, bypassing review process

- Root cause eliminated: Documentation drift between personas resolved
**Impact Assessment**:
- ✅ Review process integrity restored
- ✅ User control over backlog changes maintained  
- ✅ Efficiency benefits preserved through suggestion pattern
- ✅ Clear documentation prevents regression
- ✅ Tech Lead review gates properly enforced

**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Critical (resolved)

- Elegant solutions scale better than manual process overhead
- Git hooks + GitHub Actions provide comprehensive enforcement
**Technical Implementation**:
- Only one PR per VS item allowed through automated locking
- Branch naming pattern enforcement (feat/vs-XXX)
- CI must pass and branches must be current with main before merge
- Design conflicts detected automatically by GitHub Actions
