## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### BR_006: Parallel Incompatible Features Prevention System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Critical (resolved)
**Original Issue**: Two incompatible game designs (VS_003 merge vs VS_003A-D match) developed in parallel on different branches, causing unmergeable PRs and wasted development effort.

**Outcome**: Comprehensive automated prevention system implemented
**Solution Components**:
- Branch protection rules requiring CI pass + up-to-date branches
- Design Guard GitHub Action for VS lock management
- Automated PR validation and branch naming enforcement
- Updated GitWorkflow.md with new conventions
- Local git hooks for early validation
- PR templates to guide proper workflow

**Lessons Learned**:
- Prevention-focused automation eliminates human error
- Early detection (branch naming, PR validation) prevents costly rework
- Elegant solutions scale better than manual process overhead
- Git hooks + GitHub Actions provide comprehensive enforcement

**Unblocked**: 
- All future VS development protected from parallel incompatible implementations
- Team can work confidently without manual design coordination overhead
- Development velocity improved through automated conflict prevention

**Technical Implementation**:
- Only one PR per VS item allowed through automated locking
- Branch naming pattern enforcement (feat/vs-XXX)
- CI must pass and branches must be current with main before merge
- Design conflicts detected automatically by GitHub Actions
