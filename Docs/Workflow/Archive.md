## ‚úÖ Completed Items

### TD_024: Fix CI Test Enforcement ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Effort**: S (1 hour)
**Outcome**: Removed `|| true` from ci.yml, restored proper test failure enforcement, discovered 4 Linux-specific SaveService failures
**Lessons**: Hiding test failures with `|| true` masks critical platform-specific issues that break deployments
**Unblocked**: CI quality gates now properly enforce test success, platform issues visible and tracked (BR_009)
[METADATA: ci/cd, quality-gates, test-enforcement, platform-discovery, linux-compatibility, process-improvement]

### TD_020: Review Save System Architecture Decisions ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Effort**: S (2 hours)
**Outcome**: Switched SaveService to Newtonsoft.Json to handle 'required' properties, all 12 save tests passing
**Lessons**: Tech Lead review process caught critical serialization issues before production deployment
**Unblocked**: Save system now properly handles domain model properties without serialization failures

### TD_021: Fix Block Namespace Collision ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: Dev Engineer
**Effort**: 5 minutes (vs 8 hours estimated)
**Solution**: Used Rider's "Adjust Namespaces" feature to automatically rename Domain.Block to Domain.Blocks
**Impact**: Eliminated namespace collision affecting 40+ files, restored clean architecture
**Post-Mortem**: Created at `Docs/Post-Mortems/2025-08-19-TD021-Namespace-Collision-Fix.md`

### TD_015: Add Save System Versioning ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Effort**: XS (30 minutes)
**Outcome**: Implemented version field and migration framework in SaveData class
**Lessons**: Adding versioning before user exposure prevents painful migration scenarios
**Unblocked**: Save system can evolve safely without breaking player data

### TD_016: Document Grid Coordinate System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Effort**: XS (15 minutes)
**Outcome**: Standardized (0,0) bottom-left coordinate convention with validation helpers
**Lessons**: Early documentation prevents subtle coordinate confusion bugs
**Unblocked**: All grid operations now use consistent coordinate system

### BR_007: Backlog-Assistant Automation Misuse ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Effort**: S (2 hours)
**Outcome**: Fixed inconsistent backlog-assistant invocation patterns across all persona documentation with "Suggest-Don't-Execute" pattern
**Lessons**: Persona documentation drift can undermine process integrity; centralized protocol documentation prevents regression
**Unblocked**: Review process integrity restored, user maintains control over all backlog changes, Tech Lead review gates properly enforced

### BR_006: Parallel Incompatible Features Prevention System ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: M (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: Critical (resolved)
**Original Issue**: Two incompatible game designs (VS_003 merge vs VS_003A-D match) developed in parallel on different branches, causing unmergeable PRs and wasted development effort.

**Outcome**: Comprehensive automated prevention system implemented
**Solution Components**:
- Branch protection rules requiring CI pass + up-to-date branches
- Design Guard GitHub Action for VS lock management
- Automated PR validation and branch naming enforcement
- Updated GitWorkflow.md with new conventions
- Local git hooks for early validation
- PR templates to guide proper workflow

**Lessons Learned**:
- Prevention-focused automation eliminates human error
- Early detection (branch naming, PR validation) prevents costly rework
- Elegant solutions scale better than manual process overhead
- Git hooks + GitHub Actions provide comprehensive enforcement

**Unblocked**: 
- All future VS development protected from parallel incompatible implementations
- Team can work confidently without manual design coordination overhead
- Development velocity improved through automated conflict prevention

**Technical Implementation**:
- Only one PR per VS item allowed through automated locking
- Branch naming pattern enforcement (feat/vs-XXX)
- CI must pass and branches must be current with main before merge
- Design conflicts detected automatically by GitHub Actions

### BR_007: Backlog-Assistant Automation Misuse ‚úÖ COMPLETED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: Completed
**Effort**: S (2 hours)
**Original Issue**: Personas were automatically calling backlog-assistant instead of user explicitly invoking it, bypassing review process
**Solution**: Fixed inconsistent backlog-assistant invocation patterns across ALL persona documentation
**Impact**: Review process integrity restored, user control over backlog changes maintained, Tech Lead review gates properly enforced

**Implementation Details**:
- Fixed inconsistent backlog-assistant invocation patterns across ALL persona documentation
- Updated 5 persona files to use "Suggest-Don't-Execute" pattern instead of auto-invocation
- Preserved Strategic Prioritizer exception for meta-analysis functions
- Updated Workflow.md and CLAUDE.md with corrected protocol
- Root cause eliminated: Documentation drift between personas resolved

**Impact Assessment**:
- ‚úÖ Review process integrity restored
- ‚úÖ User control over backlog changes maintained  
- ‚úÖ Efficiency benefits preserved through suggestion pattern
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation prevents regression
- ‚úÖ Tech Lead review gates properly enforced

**Files Updated**:
- Docs/04-Personas/tech-lead.md
- Docs/04-Personas/test-specialist.md  
- Docs/04-Personas/debugger-expert.md
- Docs/04-Personas/devops-engineer.md
- Docs/04-Personas/product-owner.md
- Docs/01-Active/Workflow.md
- CLAUDE.md

### BR_006: Parallel Incompatible Features Prevention System ‚úÖ RESOLVED
**Completed**: 2025-08-19
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer
**Effort**: M (4-6 hours)
**Solution**: Comprehensive automated prevention system with branch protection, VS locking, and workflow enforcement
**Impact**: Eliminates parallel incompatible development, prevents wasted effort, ensures design consistency
**Key Components**: GitHub branch protection + Design Guard Action + PR templates + Git hooks + updated GitWorkflow.md
