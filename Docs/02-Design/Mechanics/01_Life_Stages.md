# Core Mechanic: Life Stages

This document details the design for the distinct life stages in the game, each with unique mechanics, challenges, and narrative themes.

---

## 1. Infant Stage (0-3 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Passive observation, dependency, learning basic cause-and-effect.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Small 4x4 or 5x5 grid.
    -   No "Energy" resource; game cannot be lost.
    -   Player's only action is to "cry," which creates a "Need" block.
    -   A central "Parents' Love" block automatically generates "Satisfaction" blocks (Food, Hugs) to merge with "Need" blocks.
    -   The player learns the basic merge concept through this passive, responsive world.

## 2. Childhood (4-12 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Active exploration, curiosity, understanding rules.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Grid expands to 7x7 or 8x8.
    -   A small "Energy" cost is introduced.
    -   "Curiosity" becomes the primary resource block, which can be merged into "Toys" (for "Happiness") or "Knowledge" (for "Attributes").
    -   Introduction of the first "Dream Seed" block, allowing the player to choose an initial interest.
    -   Obstacle blocks like "Rules" appear, which must be played around.

## 3. Adolescence (12-18 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Self-discovery, social complexity, internal conflict, major life choices.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Full 10x10 grid.
    -   "Mindset" resource becomes critical and highly volatile.
    -   **Academics**: "Knowledge" blocks specialize into different subjects (Math, Arts, etc.). "Exam" blocks appear as periodic "boss" challenges.
    -   **Social**: "Friendship" blocks require maintenance. "Crush" blocks are high-risk, high-reward. "Social Circles" provide belonging but also "Peer Pressure."
    -   **Internal**: "Masks" can be worn to fit in at the cost of "Mindset." "Rebellion" blocks offer short-term gains for long-term consequences.
    -   **End Event**: The "College Entrance Exam" is a multi-stage mini-game that determines the starting conditions for the next life stage.

## 4. Young Adulthood (18-25 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Freedom, exploration, financial pressure, and establishing a future foundation.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Starting conditions are determined by the outcome of the "College Entrance Exam."
    -   "Money" becomes a primary resource, alongside "Energy."
    -   Introduction of "Student Loan" debt blocks.
    -   Player must balance "Major Courses" (for "Credits" to graduate), "Part-time Jobs" (for "Money"), "Social Life," and "Hobbies."
    -   **Player Choice**: At the start of this stage, the player chooses a "Life Goal" (e.g., Academic Star, Social Butterfly, Financially Independent) which sets the primary victory condition for the stage.
    -   **End Event**: The "Thesis/Final Project" is a major "project" block that must be completed to graduate and unlock career opportunities.

## 5. Adulthood (25-40 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Balancing career, family, health, and personal dreams; managing responsibilities.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   The core challenge is managing the "Work-Life Balance" gauge.
    -   **Career**: "Daily Grind" blocks must be merged to level up a "Career" block. "Key Projects" appear as challenges. "Office Politics" and "Burnout" are new negative factors.
    -   **Family**: "Marriage" and "Child" blocks are complex systems that require constant investment of "Time" and "Money" but provide immense "Mindset" and "Legacy" rewards.
    -   **Finance**: "Salary" is paid periodically, followed by a wave of "Bills." "Mortgage" blocks are long-term, high-cost commitments.
    -   **Health**: "Energy" is renamed to "Health" and recovers more slowly. Poor management leads to "Illness" blocks.
    -   **Self**: The "Forgotten Dream" block from childhood remains, tempting the player to invest precious time and resources to reactivate it.

## 6. Middle Age (40-65 years)

-   **Core Experience**: Facing mortality, legacy, mentorship, and potential crises.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   "Health" becomes more fragile.
    -   **Legacy**: Players can now create "Protégé" blocks to pass on skills, investing in the next generation.
    -   **Midlife Crisis**: A major event that can be triggered by low "Mindset" and an ignored "Forgotten Dream," potentially resetting a major aspect of the player's life at great cost.
    -   **Family**: "Aging Parents" may require care. "Children" leave home, changing the dynamic of the "Family" block.

## 7. Elder Years (65+)

-   **Core Experience**: Reflection, wisdom, health management, and preparing a legacy.
-   **Mechanics**:
    -   "Health" is the primary resource to manage.
    -   Gameplay shifts from growth to maintenance.
    -   "Memory" blocks can be "revisited" to gain a large boost in "Mindset."
    -   The primary goal is to merge "Wisdom" blocks and complete "Legacy" projects to maximize the final "Life Score."
