## üß† Personality System (MBTI-Inspired)

### Core Philosophy
Personality develops through actions, not initial selection. Player behavior shapes traits, which unlock unique abilities.

### Four Personality Axes

#### Energy Source (I/E)
- **Introversion**: Gain from solitude, hobbies, reading
- **Extroversion**: Gain from social interaction, parties
- **Effect**: Determines resource regeneration methods

#### Information Processing (S/N)
- **Sensing**: Focus on concrete, immediate actions
- **Intuition**: Complex planning, abstract thinking
- **Effect**: S-types get steady bonuses, N-types get combo rewards

#### Decision Making (T/F)
- **Thinking**: Maximize efficiency, prioritize logic
- **Feeling**: Prioritize relationships, emotional harmony
- **Effect**: T-types grow attributes faster, F-types have better resilience

#### Lifestyle (J/P)
- **Judging**: Organization, planning, structure
- **Perceiving**: Spontaneity, adaptation, flexibility
- **Effect**: J-types benefit from order, P-types from chaos

### Implementation
- Actions nudge personality axes
- Stage-end personality reports
- Trait-based ability unlocks
- Personality solidifies with age
- "Midlife Crisis" allows dramatic shifts

## üéØ Design Principles

1. **Every mechanic tells a story** - Game systems reflect real life experiences
2. **Meaningful choices** - No optimal path, only different life journeys
3. **Emotional resonance** - Players should feel the weight of time
4. **Emergent narratives** - Stories arise from player actions
5. **Accessible depth** - Easy to play, difficult to master
