# Multi-Branch Orchestration Protocol (TD_059 Proposal)

**Document Type**: Advanced Workflow Protocol  
**Created**: 2025-08-22  
**Owner**: DevOps Engineer  
**Status**: Design Proposal  
**Priority**: Important (Next evolution after TD_058)

## üéØ Purpose

Define intelligent multi-branch state management and PR orchestration strategies for complex development scenarios involving multiple concurrent work streams.

## üö® Problem Statement

**Current Gap**: Our workflow intelligence (TD_057, TD_058) handles single-branch scenarios perfectly but lacks multi-branch orchestration:

### Real Scenarios Requiring Intelligence
1. **Multiple Complete Branches**: Which gets PR priority?
2. **Cross-Branch Dependencies**: VS_003 ‚Üí test/VS_003 ‚Üí docs/VS_003  
3. **Persona Context Switching**: Different personas, different branches
4. **Stale Branch Management**: When to rebase, abandon, or clean up
5. **Work Stream Prioritization**: Critical fixes vs features vs tech debt

### Example Multi-Branch Challenge
```bash
git branch -a
* tech/TD_058-branch-alignment        # 100% complete ‚Üí PR ready
  tech/TD_041-persona-verification    # 60% complete ‚Üí continue work
  feat/VS_003-authentication          # 40% complete ‚Üí stale (15 commits behind)
  fix/BR_013-critical-memory-leak     # 100% complete ‚Üí urgent PR needed
  test/VS_003-coverage                # blocked by VS_003
```

**Question**: Which branch gets PR priority? How do we track context across multiple streams?

## üèóÔ∏è Solution Architecture

### Component 1: Multi-Branch State Intelligence
**Enhanced Branch Analysis**: `scripts/multi-branch-status.ps1`

```powershell
# Analyze ALL branches with intelligent scoring
./scripts/multi-branch-status.ps1 --analyze-all

# Output Example:
üåø Multi-Branch Analysis (5 active branches):

üìä PR Priority Ranking:
   1. fix/BR_013-critical-memory-leak    [URGENT PR] Score: 95/100
      ‚îú‚îÄ Bug fix (high priority multiplier)
      ‚îú‚îÄ 100% complete, tested  
      ‚îî‚îÄ Blocks other development
      
   2. tech/TD_058-branch-alignment       [READY PR] Score: 88/100
      ‚îú‚îÄ Complete with documentation
      ‚îú‚îÄ Enables future workflow intelligence
      ‚îî‚îÄ No merge conflicts
      
   3. tech/TD_041-persona-verification   [CONTINUE] Score: 45/100
      ‚îú‚îÄ 60% complete, active development
      ‚îú‚îÄ No blocking dependencies
      ‚îî‚îÄ Good momentum, continue work
      
   4. feat/VS_003-authentication         [DECISION NEEDED] Score: 25/100
      ‚îú‚îÄ Stale (15 commits behind main)
      ‚îú‚îÄ Blocks test specialist work
      ‚îî‚îÄ Decision: Rebase or fresh branch?

üéØ Recommended Actions:
   ‚Ä¢ URGENT: Create PR for BR_013 (critical bug)
   ‚Ä¢ NEXT: Create PR for TD_058 after BR_013 merged
   ‚Ä¢ CONTINUE: Work on TD_041 (good progress)
   ‚Ä¢ DECIDE: VS_003 rebase vs abandon (blocking others)
```

### Component 2: PR Readiness Scoring Algorithm
**Intelligent Prioritization**:

```python
def calculate_pr_priority_score(branch_info):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Completion factors (40% of total score)
    score += branch_info.completion_percentage * 0.4
    
    # Priority multipliers (30% of total score)  
    if branch_info.type == 'fix' or branch_info.type == 'hotfix':
        score += 30  # Bug fixes get high priority
    elif branch_info.type == 'feat':
        score += 20  # Features medium priority
    elif branch_info.type == 'tech':
        score += 15  # Tech debt lower priority
        
    # Dependency impact (20% of total score)
    score += branch_info.blocks_other_work * 20
    score -= branch_info.blocked_by_others * 10
    
    # Technical readiness (10% of total score) 
    score += branch_info.has_tests * 5
    score += branch_info.no_merge_conflicts * 5
    score -= branch_info.commits_behind_main * 0.1
    
    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100
```

### Component 3: Enhanced Active Context Management

## PR Strategy Decision Matrix

### Priority Levels
1. **URGENT (90-100 points)**: Critical bugs, security fixes, blocking issues
2. **HIGH (70-89 points)**: Complete features, important enhancements  
3. **MEDIUM (40-69 points)**: Active development, good momentum
4. **LOW (0-39 points)**: Stale work, experimental branches
5. **DECISION (<25 points)**: Abandon candidates, cleanup needed

### PR Sequencing Rules
1. **Dependencies First**: Branches that unblock other work
2. **Bug Fixes Priority**: Critical issues before features
3. **Completion Priority**: Finished work before in-progress
4. **Size Consideration**: Small changes before large ones
5. **Risk Assessment**: Low-risk changes first

### Context Switching Guidelines
**When to Switch Branches**:
- Current branch blocked by external dependency
- Higher priority work becomes available (urgent fixes)
- Context switching cost < continuation benefit
- Persona handoff requires different branch

**When to Stay Focused**:
- Current branch >50% complete with momentum
- Context switching cost high (complex state)
- No urgent blockers in other branches
- Single-session completion possible

## Implementation Proposal: TD_059

### Phase 1: Multi-Branch Status Intelligence
- **Enhanced branch-status-check.ps1**: Analyze all local branches
- **PR readiness scoring**: Automated priority calculation  
- **Dependency detection**: Cross-branch impact analysis
- **Stale branch identification**: Cleanup recommendations

### Phase 2: Active Context Multi-Stream
- **Memory Bank enhancement**: Track multiple work streams
- **Context switching guidance**: When and how to switch focus
- **Priority matrix maintenance**: Dynamic work prioritization
- **Session continuity**: Remember context across sessions

### Phase 3: Automated PR Orchestration
- **Smart PR suggestions**: "Ready branches detected, create PRs?"
- **Dependency-aware sequencing**: "Wait for X to merge before Y"  
- **Branch cleanup automation**: "3 merged branches ready for cleanup"
- **Cross-persona coordination**: "VS_003 ready, notify Test Specialist"

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Metrics
- **Context switching overhead**: Reduced time lost between branches
- **PR sequencing optimization**: Fewer merge conflicts, faster reviews
- **Work stream completion**: Higher percentage of branches reaching PR
- **Decision clarity**: Reduced time spent on "what to work on next"

### Quality Metrics  
- **Dependency satisfaction**: Fewer blocked work streams
- **Branch lifecycle health**: Reduced stale/abandoned branches
- **PR review efficiency**: Better organized, focused pull requests
- **Cross-persona coordination**: Smoother handoffs between specialists

## Integration with Existing Systems

### TD_057 (Critical Warning Enforcement)
- Multi-branch analysis respects main branch protection
- PR recommendations include enforcement compliance

### TD_058 (Branch Alignment Intelligence)  
- Per-branch validation still applies
- Multi-branch context enhances alignment decisions

### Memory Bank System
- Enhanced activeContext.md with multi-stream tracking
- Session continuity across complex work portfolios

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Intelligence (Phase 4+)
- **Machine learning**: Pattern recognition for optimal work sequences
- **Predictive analysis**: "Branch X likely to conflict with Y"
- **Resource optimization**: "Dev cycle efficiency maximization"
- **Cross-team coordination**: Multi-persona workflow orchestration

---

**Strategic Value**: This protocol transforms development from reactive branch management to proactive work stream orchestration, enabling sophisticated multi-branch intelligence that maximizes developer efficiency and work quality.

**Next Steps**: Implement as TD_059 after TD_058 PR completion, building on the foundation of branch alignment intelligence to create comprehensive multi-branch workflow automation.
