# Vertical Slice Architecture Plan for BlockLife

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive vertical slice architecture plan for the BlockLife project, designed to maximize development efficiency while maintaining the strict Clean Architecture + MVP pattern established in the Architecture Guide v3.1. This plan defines how to decompose the complex game into manageable, independently deliverable vertical slices that integrate seamlessly into the existing CQRS + functional programming foundation.

## 1. Vertical Slice Definition & Philosophy

### 1.1 What Constitutes a Complete Vertical Slice

A **complete vertical slice** in BlockLife is defined as an end-to-end feature implementation that spans all architectural layers and delivers a single, user-perceivable game capability. Each slice must include:

1. **Pure Model Logic**: Commands, Handlers, Domain Services, and Business Rules (in `src/`)
2. **State Management**: Effects, Notifications, and Read Model Projections
3. **Rule Engine Integration**: Pattern matchers and rule definitions for the slice's mechanics
4. **Presentation Contracts**: View interfaces and Presenter implementations
5. **Godot Integration**: View implementations, Controller Nodes, and scene files
6. **Testing**: Unit tests for core logic and integration tests for presentation
7. **Animation & Feedback**: Visual feedback systems and state transitions

### 1.2 Slice Boundaries Principles

**Domain Cohesion**: Each slice represents a cohesive game mechanic or feature that can be understood and implemented independently.

**Technical Independence**: Slices should minimize cross-dependencies at the implementation level while sharing infrastructure services.

**User Value**: Each slice delivers tangible value to end users and can be demonstrated as a working feature.

**Testing Isolation**: Each slice can be tested independently without requiring other slices to be complete.

## 3. Integration Strategy

### 3.1 Shared Infrastructure Components

These components are shared across all slices and must be designed for extensibility:

#### Core Services (Singleton Scope)
- `IGridStateService`: Central authority for grid state
- `ISystemStateService`: Manages global system locks and states
- `ISimulationManager`: Effect processing and notification publishing
- `IRuleEngine<GridStateDto>`: Rule evaluation coordination
- `ISpatialIndex<BlockDto>`: Optimized spatial queries

#### Shared Interfaces
- `ICommand`/`IQuery`: CQRS contracts
- `IEffect`/`INotification`: Event flow contracts
- `IPresenterFactory`: DI bridge for presentation layer
- `IValidationRule<T>`: Reusable business rule contracts

#### Infrastructure Services
- Logging: `Serilog.ILogger` with structured logging
- DI Container: `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`
- Serialization: System.Text.Json with custom converters
- Animation: Shared animation queue management

#### Data Storage Strategy
- **Simple Game Data**: Use pure C# records and enums (e.g., `Block`, `BlockType`) to maintain Clean Architecture
- **Complex Visual Assets**: Reserve Godot Resources for later slices requiring rich visual properties (Slice C2+)
- **Configuration Data**: Use C# configuration classes with JSON serialization
- **Asset References**: Godot PackedScenes and Resources referenced only in View layer

### 3.2 Slice Isolation Patterns

#### Command/Query Separation
Each slice owns its commands and queries but may read from other slices' read models.

```csharp
// Slice C1 can send commands to its own handlers
await _mediator.Send(new AdvanceLifeStageCommand(blockId));

// But reads from other slices through queries
var gridState = await _mediator.Send(new GetGridStateQuery());
```

#### Effect/Notification Decoupling
Slices communicate through the effect/notification pipeline, maintaining loose coupling.

```csharp
// Slice F2 publishes block movement
_simulationManager.Enqueue(new BlockMovedEffect(blockId, newPosition));

// Slice C1 reacts to movement for life stage rules
public class LifeStageNotificationHandler : INotificationHandler<BlockMovedNotification>
{
    // React to movement without tight coupling to movement slice
}
```

#### Presenter Composition
Complex views can compose multiple slice presenters through dependency injection.

```csharp
public class GridPresenter : PresenterBase<IGridView>
{
    private readonly MovementPresenter _movementPresenter;
    private readonly LifeStagePresenter _lifeStagePresenter;
    
    // Compose behaviors from multiple slices
}
```

### 3.3 Data Consistency Patterns

#### Read Model Projections
Each slice maintains its own read models, updated via notification handlers.

```csharp
public class LifeStageProjector : INotificationHandler<BlockPlacedNotification>
{
    public async Task Handle(BlockPlacedNotification notification, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // Update life stage read model when blocks are placed
        await _lifeStageReadModel.InitializeBlockStage(notification.BlockId);
    }
}
```

#### Eventual Consistency
Accept that read models may be one frame behind authoritative state for performance.

### 5.2 Rule Engine Integration Patterns

#### Pattern Matcher Registration
```csharp
// Each slice registers its pattern matchers
public class LifeStageSliceBootstrapper
{
    public void ConfigureRuleEngine(IRuleEngine<GridStateDto> ruleEngine)
    {
        var lifeStageMatchers = new[]
        {
            _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<LifeStageProgressionMatcher>(),
            _serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<LifeStageTransitionMatcher>()
        };
        
        foreach (var matcher in lifeStageMatchers)
        {
            ruleEngine.RegisterMatcher(matcher);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Cross-Slice Rule Dependencies
```csharp
public class CrossSlicePatternMatcher : IPatternMatcher<GridStateDto>
{
    // Can depend on read models from multiple slices
    private readonly ILifeStageReadModel _lifeStageReadModel;
    private readonly IResourceReadModel _resourceReadModel;
    
    public Fin<IReadOnlyCollection<IRuleMatchResult>> FindMatches(GridStateDto context)
    {
        // Combine data from multiple slices for complex rules
        return from lifeStageData in _lifeStageReadModel.GetLifeStages(context.Blocks)
               from resourceData in _resourceReadModel.GetBlockResources(context.Blocks)
               select EvaluateCrossSlicePattern(context, lifeStageData, resourceData);
    }
}
```

### 5.3 Animation Coordination Patterns

#### Slice-Specific Animation Controllers
```csharp
// Each slice can define its own animation capabilities
public interface ILifeStageAnimationView
{
    Task PlayStageTransitionAsync(Guid blockId, LifeStage fromStage, LifeStage toStage);
    Task PlayStageEffectAsync(Guid blockId, LifeStageEffect effect);
}

public interface IMovementAnimationView
{
    Task AnimateMoveAsync(Guid blockId, Vector2 fromPosition, Vector2 toPosition);
    Task AnimateSwapAsync(Guid blockId1, Guid blockId2);
}

// Main view composes all animation capabilities
public interface IGridView
{
    ILifeStageAnimationView LifeStageAnimator { get; }
    IMovementAnimationView MovementAnimator { get; }
    IPatternAnimationView PatternAnimator { get; }
}
```

#### Animation Coordination
```csharp
public class GridPresenter : PresenterBase<IGridView>
{
    // Coordinates animations from multiple slices
    public async Task HandleComplexGameEvent(ComplexGameEventNotification notification)
    {
        // Sequential animations
        await View.MovementAnimator.AnimateMoveAsync(notification.BlockId, notification.FromPos, notification.ToPos);
        await View.LifeStageAnimator.PlayStageTransitionAsync(notification.BlockId, notification.FromStage, notification.ToStage);
        
        // Parallel animations
        var patternTask = View.PatternAnimator.HighlightPatternAsync(notification.PatternBlocks);
        var effectTask = View.LifeStageAnimator.PlayStageEffectAsync(notification.BlockId, notification.Effect);
        
        await Task.WhenAll(patternTask, effectTask);
    }
}
```

## 6. Testing Strategy

        // Act
        var result = await handler.Handle(command, CancellationToken.None);
        
        // Assert
        result.Should().BeSuccessful();
        _mockGridStateService.Verify(s => s.UpdateBlockPosition(blockId, newPosition));

        // Act
        var result = matcher.FindMatches(gridState);
        
        // Assert
        result.Should().BeSuccessful();
        result.Value.Should().HaveCount(2);
        result.Value.Should().OnlyContain(m => m.PatternType == "LifeStageProgression");
    }

        var gridPresenter = CreateIntegratedGridPresenter();
        await SetupLifeStageProgressionScenario();
        
        // Act - Move a block to trigger life stage rules
        await gridPresenter.HandleMoveCommand(new MoveBlockCommand(blockId, newPosition));
        
        // Assert - Verify life stage progression occurred
        var lifeStageState = await _mediator.Send(new GetLifeStageQuery(blockId));
        lifeStageState.Value.CurrentStage.Should().Be(LifeStage.Young);
    }
}
```

    // Act
    var result = await _ruleEngine.EvaluateRules(complexGridState);
    stopwatch.Stop();
    
    // Assert
    result.Should().BeSuccessful();
    stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds.Should().BeLessThan(100); // 100ms target for complex evaluation
}
```

### 6.3 End-to-End Testing

    await WaitForResourceGeneration();
    AssertResourcesGeneratedFromPattern();
}
```

## 7. Risk Mitigation & Performance Considerations

### 7.1 Integration Risks

#### Circular Dependencies
**Risk**: Slices depending on each other's internal implementations
**Mitigation**: 
- Strict enforcement of interface-based communication
- Regular dependency graph analysis
- Code review focus on cross-slice dependencies

#### Performance Degradation
**Risk**: Rule engine performance degrades with slice additions
**Mitigation**:
- Performance benchmarks for each slice
- Spatial indexing optimization
- Rule priority and conflict resolution optimization

#### Testing Complexity
**Risk**: Integration testing becomes unwieldy with many slices
**Mitigation**:
- Hierarchical test organization
- Shared test infrastructure
- Focus on critical user paths for end-to-end tests

### 7.2 Performance Optimization Strategies

#### Rule Engine Optimization
```csharp
// Priority-based evaluation with early termination
public class OptimizedRuleEngine : IRuleEngine<GridStateDto>
{
    public Fin<IReadOnlyCollection<IRuleMatchResult>> EvaluateRules(GridStateDto context)
    {
        var results = new List<IRuleMatchResult>();
        var usedBlocks = new HashSet<Guid>();
        
        // Evaluate high-priority matchers first
        foreach (var matcher in _matchers.OrderByDescending(m => m.Priority))
        {
            var matches = matcher.FindMatches(context);
            if (matches.IsSucc)
            {
                // Filter out matches using already-matched blocks
                var validMatches = matches.Value
                    .Where(m => !m.MatchedBlockIds.Any(id => usedBlocks.Contains(id)));
                    
                foreach (var match in validMatches)
                {
                    results.Add(match);
                    usedBlocks.UnionWith(match.MatchedBlockIds);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return results;
    }
}
```

#### Animation Performance
```csharp
// Batched animation processing
public class BatchedAnimationPresenter : PresenterBase<IGridView>
{
    private readonly List<AnimationRequest> _pendingAnimations = new();
    
    public async Task ProcessAnimationBatch()
    {
        // Group animations by type for efficient processing
        var movementAnimations = _pendingAnimations.OfType<MovementAnimationRequest>();
        var lifeStageAnimations = _pendingAnimations.OfType<LifeStageAnimationRequest>();
        
        // Process groups in parallel
        var movementTask = ProcessMovementAnimations(movementAnimations);
        var lifeStageTask = ProcessLifeStageAnimations(lifeStageAnimations);
        
        await Task.WhenAll(movementTask, lifeStageTask);
    }
}
```
