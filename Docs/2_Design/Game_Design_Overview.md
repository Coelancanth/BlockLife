## **Game Overview**
This is a tile-based life simulation game that combines merge mechanics with resource management and life progression through different life stages.

---

Our core mechanic is a life simulation game built on a grid. Players merge blocks with different narratives, such as Work and Study, to progress through life stages.

A rule engine constantly checks the grid for specific patterns. When a pattern is matched, the blocks are cleared, and a new block is generated on the trigger position on the grid based on a set of rules. This new block can, in turn, trigger a chain reaction. This is the central loop that drives the entire game.
