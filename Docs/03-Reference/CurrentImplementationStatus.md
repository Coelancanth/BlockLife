## 🎮 Player Experience Reality

### What Players Can ACTUALLY Do Right Now

#### ✅ Core Gameplay Working
1. **Place blocks** on 10x10 grid via click
2. **Drag blocks** to new positions (3-range limit with visual feedback)
3. **Match-3 blocks** to earn resources (automatic pattern detection)
4. **Purchase merge unlocks** via F8 debug panel (100/500/2500 Money)
5. **Merge blocks** into higher tiers (when unlocked, replaces match behavior)
6. **See block information** - type and tier displayed on each block (e.g., "Work T2")
7. **Experience merge animations** - blocks converge, flash, and burst
8. **Track resources** - Money and attributes visible in UI

#### ⚠️ Debug-Only Features (Need Player UI)
- **Merge unlock purchases** - Currently requires F8 debug panel (VS_005 will fix this)
- **Performance profiling** - F9/F10/F11 hotkeys for developers

#### ❌ Not Implemented Yet
- **Auto-spawn system** - No turn-based pressure mechanics
- **Transmutation** - Logic exists but no UI trigger
- **Save/Load** - No persistence between sessions
- **Grid expansion** - Fixed 10x10 size
- **Life stages** - No aging or time progression
- **Narrative events** - No story elements

## 🏗️ Vertical Slice Implementation Map

### VS_001: Block Placement & Movement [COMPLETE]
**Player Action Flow:**
```
Click Empty Cell → PlaceBlockCommand → ValidationRules → GridStateService
    ↓ Data: Position → Block Entity → Grid State Update
    ✅ Place, move, swap, remove operations
    ✅ 3-position range validation
    ✅ Visual feedback for valid/invalid moves
```

### VS_003A: Match-3 Pattern System [COMPLETE]
**Pattern Recognition Flow:**
```
Block Placed/Moved → ProcessPatternsAfterPlacement → MatchPatternRecognizer
    ↓ Data: Grid State → Adjacent Blocks → Match Groups (3+)
    ↓ Execution: MatchPatternExecutor → Remove Blocks → Grant Resources
    ✅ Automatic pattern detection on placement/movement
    ✅ Resource rewards (Money: 10×multiplier, Attributes: varied)
    ✅ Chain multipliers (×1.5 for 4-match, ×2.0 for 5-match)
```

### VS_003B: Merge Pattern System [COMPLETE]
**Merge Unlock & Execution Flow:**
```
Player Has Money → F8 Debug Panel → PurchaseMergeUnlockCommand
    ↓ Data: MaxUnlockedTier Update (T1→T2, costs 100 Money)
    
When T2+ Unlocked → Pattern Recognition Changes:
    Same blocks detected → MergePatternExecutor (replaces MatchPatternExecutor)
    ↓ Data: 3 T1 blocks → 1 T2 block at center position
    ↓ Visual: Convergence animation → Flash → Burst effect
    ✅ Progressive unlock system (T2: 100, T3: 500, T4: 2500)
    ✅ Merge REPLACES match behavior when unlocked
    ⚠️ Debug UI only - needs VS_005 for player accessibility
```

### VS_003B-3: Pattern Framework Architecture [COMPLETE]
**Technical Foundation:**
```
IPatternRecognizer → Detects patterns in grid
IPatternResolver → Determines which executor to use
IPatternExecutor → Executes pattern (match vs merge)
    ↓ PatternExecutionResolver makes decisions based on:
    - Player's MaxUnlockedTier
    - Block tiers in pattern
    - Pattern type (match/merge)
    ✅ Extensible for future patterns (transmutation, special)
```

## 🔌 Integration Points & Data Flow

### Pattern System Integration
```
User Input → Command → Notification → Pattern Processing
                           ↓
                    ProcessPatternsAfterPlacement
                    ProcessPatternsAfterMove
                           ↓
                    PatternExecutionResolver
                    (Decides: Match or Merge?)
                           ↓
                    MatchExecutor / MergeExecutor
                           ↓
                    State Updates + Visual Feedback
```

### Resource Flow
```
Pattern Execution → Rewards Calculated → ApplyMatchRewardsCommand
    ↓ Updates PlayerState:
    - Resources (Money, Social Capital)
    - Attributes (Knowledge, Health, etc.)
    ↓ UI Updates via IPlayerStateService
```

### Visual System
```
Domain Events → BlockVisualizationController
    - ShowBlockAsync(id, pos, type, tier)
    - ShowMergeAnimationAsync(sources, target, tier)
    - AddBlockInfoDisplay(type, tier) - Shows "Work T2" labels
    - Tier-based scaling (T1: 1.0x, T2: 1.15x, T3: 1.3x, T4: 1.5x)
    - Tier-based effects (T2: pulse, T3: glow, T4: particles)
```

## 📊 Technical Foundation Details

### Architecture Layers
- **Godot UI** → Presentation layer with visual controllers
- **Application** → CQRS commands/queries with MediatR
- **Domain** → Pure C# core with LanguageExt functional types
- **Infrastructure** → Services, persistence (when implemented)

### Key Services
- **IGridStateService**: Thread-safe block management
- **IPlayerStateService**: Resource and attribute tracking
- **IMergeUnlockService**: Unlock progression management
- **IPatternRecognizer**: Pattern detection algorithms
- **IBlockVisualizationView**: Visual representation contract

### Performance Optimizations
- Tween system pre-warming (eliminates 289ms first-move lag)
- Concurrent dictionary for thread-safe grid operations
- Performance profiler integration (F9/F10/F11)
- Efficient pattern detection with position caching

## 🚧 Partial Implementations

### Block Transmutation
- ✅ Combination logic defined (Work + Study → Career)
- ❌ No UI trigger mechanism
- ❌ No visual feedback system
- ❌ Not integrated with pattern framework

### Player Progression
- ✅ Starting resources granted (100 Money, varied attributes)
- ✅ Resource earning through matches
- ✅ Unlock purchasing system
- ❌ No save/load persistence
- ❌ No achievement tracking

## 📈 Next Logical Steps (Product Owner Perspective)

### Immediate Needs (Blocking Gameplay)
1. **VS_005**: User-facing merge unlock UI (remove F8 dependency)
2. **VS_006**: Auto-spawn system (turn-based pressure mechanic)

### Core Loop Completion
3. **VS_003C**: Transmutation patterns (cross-type combinations)
4. **Save/Load**: Game persistence

### Polish & Expansion
5. Grid expansion mechanics
6. Special block types
7. Life stage progression

## 🔍 Reality Check

### What's Really Working Well
- Pattern framework is robust and extensible
- Merge system fully replaces match behavior as designed
- Visual feedback is comprehensive (type, tier, animations)
- Test coverage is excellent (401 passing tests)
- Performance is optimized (pre-warming, profiling)

### Hidden Complexities Found
- Pattern resolution logic correctly handles tier mismatches
- Merge animations properly handle multiple source blocks
- Resource calculations include proper chain multipliers
- Block info display works for all tiers (not just T2+)

### Technical Debt Addressed
- BF_001: First-move lag eliminated via tween pre-warming
- Thread safety: ConcurrentDictionary prevents race conditions
- Duplicate notifications: Handled gracefully in visualization
