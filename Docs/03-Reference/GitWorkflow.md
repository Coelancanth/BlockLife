# Git Workflow - The Single Source of Truth

**IMPORTANT**: This is the ONLY git workflow guide. All personas and documentation reference this file.

## üö® The Iron Rules (Enforced Automatically)

1. **NEVER work directly on main** - Branch protection blocks direct pushes
2. **ALWAYS fetch before creating branches** - Start from latest code
3. **ALWAYS rebase before pushing** - Branch must be up-to-date with main
4. **COMMIT frequently** - Small, focused commits are better
5. **CI MUST PASS** - Merges blocked until build-and-test succeeds
6. **NO PARALLEL WORK** - VS lock system prevents duplicate efforts

## üìú The Sacred Sequence

This is the ONLY workflow you need to memorize:

```bash
# 1. Start fresh (MANDATORY first step)
git fetch origin
git checkout main && git pull origin main

# 2. Create your feature branch FROM UPDATED MAIN
# IMPORTANT: Use proper naming convention!
# VS items: feat/vs-XXX-description
# BR items: fix/br-XXX-description  
# TD items: feat/td-XXX-description
git checkout -b feat/vs-003-match-system  # Example

# 3. Do your work, commit frequently
git add .
git commit -m "feat: clear description"

# 4. Before pushing, REBASE on latest main
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# 5. Push your branch
git push -u origin feat/vs-003-match-system

# 6. Create PR via GitHub (template will guide you)
gh pr create --title "feat: title" --body "description"
```

## üîí Branch Naming Convention (NEW - Prevents BR_006)

**MANDATORY naming patterns** for work items:
- **VS items**: `feat/vs-XXX-description` (e.g., `feat/vs-003-match-system`)
- **BR items**: `fix/br-XXX-description` (e.g., `fix/br-006-parallel-work`)
- **TD items**: `feat/td-XXX-description` (e.g., `feat/td-009-persona-commands`)
- **Other work**: `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `chore/` (no restrictions)

**Why this matters**:
- Automated VS lock system prevents parallel work on same item
- Clear intent from branch name
- Automatic backlog validation
- PR template auto-fills from branch name

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What Happens If You Skip Steps?

**Skip Step 1 (fetch/pull)?**
- You branch from outdated code
- You "fix" already-fixed bugs  
- You create conflicts for others

**Skip Step 4 (rebase)?**
- Git hook BLOCKS your push ‚ùå
- You must rebase before pushing
- This is enforced automatically

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Scenarios

### "I forgot to create a branch!"
```bash
git stash                          # Save your work
git checkout main                  
git pull origin main               
git checkout -b feat/proper-name  
git stash pop                      # Restore your work
```

### "I need to update my branch with latest main"
```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main

# If conflicts occur:
# 1. Fix conflicts in your editor
# 2. git add <fixed-files>
# 3. git rebase --continue
```

### "The pre-push hook blocked me!"
```bash
# This means you're behind main. Fix it:
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push  # Now it will work
```

## ü§ñ For AI Assistants

**MANDATORY BEHAVIOR**:
1. ALWAYS run the sacred sequence when starting work
2. NEVER skip the fetch/pull steps
3. Output each git command as you run it
4. If the hook blocks you, rebase immediately

**Example AI workflow output**:
```
"Starting work on feat/block-rotation..."
> git fetch origin
> git checkout main && git pull origin main  
> git checkout -b feat/block-rotation
"Branch created from latest main ‚úÖ"
```

## üîß Hook Installation

First time setup (run once):
```bash
# Windows
./scripts/install-hooks.ps1

# Linux/Mac
./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

The pre-push hook will:
- ‚ùå Block pushes to main
- ‚ùå Block pushes from outdated branches  
- ‚úÖ Allow pushes from up-to-date branches
- üìù Provide clear fix instructions when blocking

## üìù Commit Message Format

```
type: description

Types:
feat:     New feature
fix:      Bug fix
refactor: Code restructuring
test:     Test changes
docs:     Documentation only
perf:     Performance improvement
chore:    Maintenance tasks
```

Examples:
- `feat: add block rotation with Q/E keys`
- `fix: prevent blocks from overlapping`
- `refactor: extract validation logic`

## üöÄ Why This Workflow?

1. **Prevents conflicts** - Always working from latest code
2. **Clean history** - Rebase keeps history linear
3. **No surprises** - Everyone follows same rules
4. **Automated safety** - Hooks catch mistakes
5. **Fast integration** - PRs merge cleanly

## ü§ñ Automated Protections (Active Now!)

### Branch Protection (GitHub)
- ‚ùå **Direct pushes to main blocked** - Must use PR
- ‚ùå **Merges blocked if CI fails** - Tests must pass
- ‚ùå **Merges blocked if branch outdated** - Must rebase first
- ‚úÖ **Review required** - At least 1 approval needed

### VS Lock System (Design Guard)
When you open a PR for a work item (VS/BR/TD):
1. **Checks for conflicts** - Fails if someone else is working on same item
2. **Adds lock label** - Shows item is in progress
3. **Validates backlog** - Warns if item not found
4. **Releases lock** - Automatically when PR closes

### What This Prevents
- ‚úÖ **No more BR_006** - Parallel incompatible features impossible
- ‚úÖ **No broken builds on main** - CI must pass
- ‚úÖ **No merge conflicts** - Branches must be current
- ‚úÖ **Clear ownership** - Lock labels show who's working on what
