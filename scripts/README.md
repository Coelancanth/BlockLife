# BlockLife Automation Scripts

Organized automation tools for building, testing, git workflow, and development productivity.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Essential Build Commands
```powershell
# Windows
./scripts/core/build.ps1 test    # Build + run tests (safe default)
./scripts/core/build.ps1 build   # Build only
./scripts/core/build.ps1 all     # Clean, build, and test

# Linux/Mac
./scripts/core/build.sh test     # Build + run tests (safe default)
./scripts/core/build.sh build    # Build only
./scripts/core/build.sh all      # Clean, build, and test
```

### Git Workflow Setup
```powershell
# Windows
./scripts/git/install-hooks.ps1   # Install git hooks

# Linux/Mac
./scripts/git/install-hooks.sh    # Install git hooks
```

## CI/CD Integration

These scripts are used by:
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Local development workflow
- Pre-commit testing

## Design Principles

1. **Simple** - No complex dependency management
2. **Fast** - Direct dotnet commands, no overhead
3. **Portable** - Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac
4. **Focused** - Does one thing well

## Adding New Scripts

When adding automation:
1. Keep it simple - avoid over-engineering
2. Document usage clearly
3. Support both Windows and Linux when possible
4. Test locally before committing
