# Testing Automation

Testing, coverage, and performance automation scripts.

## Planned Scripts

### Test Execution
- `run-all-tests.ps1/.sh` - Comprehensive test runner with filtering
- `coverage.ps1/.sh` - Code coverage generation and reporting
- `performance.ps1/.sh` - Performance benchmarking and profiling

### Test Categories
- Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- Integration tests (component interaction)
- Performance tests (benchmark validation)
- Stress tests (concurrency and load)

## Current Status

**Status**: Placeholder - Scripts to be implemented as needed

**Current Testing**: Use `../core/build.ps1 test` for standard test execution

## Future Features

- Test result reporting and visualization
- Coverage threshold enforcement
- Performance regression detection
- Automated test data generation
