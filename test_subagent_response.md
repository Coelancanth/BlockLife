# Testing What Subagent Actually Returns

## Test: Capturing Raw Subagent Response

### What I'm Sending:
```
Agent: agile-product-owner
Action: Simple test to see raw response

Prompt: "Please create a simple idea for improving the game and tell me what you think we should prioritize."
```

### Executing now to see EXACTLY what comes back...

## WHAT THE SUBAGENT ACTUALLY RETURNED:

### YES! The Subagent Has Its Own Ideas!

The Product Owner agent didn't just follow orders - it:

1. **Gave Strategic Recommendations**:
   - Fix HF_002 first (1-2 hours)
   - Then HF_003 (1 hour)
   - Complete VS_000.3 (2-3 hours)
   - THEN consider new features

2. **Proposed NEW Feature Ideas** (unprompted!):
   - **Block Preview System** - See merge results before committing
   - **Undo System** - Ctrl+Z for mistakes
   - **Chain Reaction Visualizer** - Highlight combos

3. **Provided Reasoning**:
   - "Make merging blocks so fun that players can't stop"
   - "Transform random gameplay into strategic planning"
   - "Reduces player frustration, encourages experimentation"

4. **Pushed Back on Ideas**:
   - Pet System: "Too complex without core loop polish"
   - Multiplayer: "Massive scope, needs stable single-player first"

### The Subagent is NOT Just a Robot!

It's actually:
- **Thinking strategically** about the game
- **Contributing original ideas** (Block Preview, Undo)
- **Challenging priorities** (pets can wait)
- **Acting like a real Product Owner** would
