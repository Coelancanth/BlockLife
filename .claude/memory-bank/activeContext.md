# Active Context
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21 09:35
**Session**: DevOps Engineer
**Expires**: 2025-08-28

## Current Work
- **Completed**: Git workflow redesign (removed Sacred Sequence)
- **Completed**: Husky.NET implementation (TD_039)
- **Active**: Memory Bank Protocol definition
- **Pending**: TD_042 - Consolidate duplicate archives
- **Pending**: TD_038 - Architectural consistency validation

## Open Branches
- feat/td-037-persona-docs (current)

## Key Decisions This Session
- Replaced Sacred Sequence with standard git + Husky.NET
- Standardized branch naming to VS_003 format (underscores)
- Added branch-freshness check to CI (>20 commits = fail)
- Designed Memory Bank Protocol with clear update triggers

## Infrastructure Changes
- Deleted scripts/git/ (legacy Sacred Sequence)
- Created .husky/ folder with 4 hooks
- Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml with freshness check
- Created comprehensive GitWorkflow.md

## Handoff Notes
- Husky.NET auto-installs via `dotnet tool restore`
- All 6 persona clones will get hooks automatically
- TD_042 (archive consolidation) is critical - data integrity risk
- Memory Bank Protocol now documented and active
