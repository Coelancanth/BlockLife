# Active Context - BlockLife Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21 20:30
**Session**: DevOps Engineer
**Expires**: 2025-08-28

## Current Git State
- **Active Persona**: DevOps Engineer
- **Current Branch**: main
- **Working Directory**: Clean (all changes committed)
- **Ahead of origin**: 8 commits (need to push)
- **Last Commit**: `3b1a445 - docs: update TD_052 to reflect final implementation`

## Today's Major Accomplishments
- ✅ **CLAUDE.md Consolidation**: Reduced from 534 to 361 lines (32% reduction)
- ✅ **GitWorkflow.md Created**: Comprehensive git documentation with troubleshooting
- ✅ **Git Hooks Enhanced**: All hooks now developer-friendly (auto-format, smart build, etc.)
- ✅ **TD_052 COMPLETED**: Simple Memory Bank sync with hook integration (~70 lines)
- ✅ **TD_051 Rejected**: Over-engineered solution replaced with simple approach
- ✅ **Memory Bank Restructured**: Removed decisions.md, 7-day rotation, no compaction

## Memory Bank Changes
- **Structure**: Simplified to 4 files (activeContext, SESSION_LOG, patterns-recent, troubleshooting)
- **Sync**: Fully automatic via git hooks (post-checkout, pre-commit, pre-push)
- **Rotation**: 7-day SESSION_LOG (was 30 days, then 3, now 7)
- **Removed**: decisions.md (use backlog), compaction feature (unnecessary)

## Infrastructure Improvements
- **memory-sync.ps1**: ~70 lines, pull/push/status operations
- **Hook Integration**: Auto-sync on git operations, zero manual work
- **Error Handling**: Robust with `|| true` to prevent hook failures
- **Husky Installed**: Verified working with `core.hookspath = .husky`

## Next Priorities (DevOps-Owned)
1. **TD_032**: Fix persona routing documentation (Important, moved up)
2. **TD_046**: Complete git workflow documentation (Important)
3. **TD_047**: Improve persona backlog protocols (Approved)
4. **TD_050**: Enhance DevOps protocol with activeContext (Approved)
5. **TD_038**: Architectural consistency validation (Approved)
6. **TD_033**: PowerShell validation prototype (Ideas)

## Key Decisions Made
- Rejected complex Memory Bank sync (TD_051) in favor of simple solution
- 7-day rotation more practical than 3-day for weekly workflows
- Removed compaction - activeContext naturally stays small
- decisions.md removed - backlog is single source of truth

## Files Modified Today
- CLAUDE.md (consolidated)
- .husky/* (all hooks enhanced)
- scripts/memory-sync.ps1 (created)
- scripts/migrate-memory-bank.ps1 (created)
- Docs/03-Reference/GitWorkflow.md (created)
- Docs/02-Design/Memory-Bank-Sync-Architecture.md (created for TD_051, then rejected)
- Docs/01-Active/Backlog.md (multiple updates)

## Session Notes
- Tech Lead was active in backlog, reviewing and approving/rejecting items
- Focus on simplicity over complexity proved correct
- Hook-driven automation eliminates manual sync burden
- Developer experience significantly improved with hook enhancements
