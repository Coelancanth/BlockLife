# Active Context - BlockLife Development

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-21  
**Session**: DevOps Engineer  
**Expires**: 2025-08-28

## Current Sprint Focus
- **Date**: 2025-08-21
- **Active Work**: TD_039 - Husky.NET Implementation (PR #56)

## Today's Completed Items
- ✅ TD_030: Simplified persona backlog update suggestions
- ✅ TD_031: Added verification step for subagent work  
- ✅ TD_040: Systematic review of Claude Code best practices
- ✅ TD_039: Husky.NET implementation - **PR #56 created**
- ✅ Implemented Memory Bank system from best practices
- ✅ Git workflow redesign (removed Sacred Sequence)
- ✅ Updated all documentation for consistency

## Active Branch
- `feat/td-037-persona-docs` (PR #56 with merge conflicts)

## Infrastructure Changes
- Deleted scripts/git/ (legacy Sacred Sequence)
- Created .husky/ folder with 4 hooks
- Updated .github/workflows/ci.yml with freshness check
- Created comprehensive GitWorkflow.md

## Key Decisions This Session
- Replaced Sacred Sequence with standard git + Husky.NET
- Standardized branch naming to VS_003 format (underscores)
- Adopted "Trust but Verify" model for subagent verification
- Simplified backlog suggestion format to bullet points
- Identified 15 adoptable patterns from community repos

## Next Priority Items
1. **TD_042**: Consolidate Duplicate Archive Files (CRITICAL - data integrity risk)
2. TD_041: Verify Persona Embodiment Flow
3. TD_038: Create Architectural Consistency Validation System
4. TD_032: Fix Persona Documentation Routing Gaps

## Context to Maintain
- Multi-clone architecture (6 personas, 6 clones)
- Clean Architecture with MVP pattern
- Glossary enforcement is critical
- Move Block pattern is reference implementation

## Handoff Notes
- **PR #56 has merge conflicts** - resolving now
- Husky.NET auto-installs via `dotnet tool restore`
- All 6 persona clones will get hooks automatically
- TD_042 (archive consolidation) is critical - data integrity risk
- Memory Bank Protocol now documented and active
